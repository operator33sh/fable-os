/* tool.h — the model's syscall interface.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   Gives the model the ability to *act on this machine* rather than only print
 *   text about it. A tool is a kernel function the model may invoke by name: the
 *   VFS, the device registry, the heap allocator, PCI config space. When the
 *   model asks to write a file, real bytes land in a real filesystem, and the
 *   kernel prints a trace line proving it (see trace.h).
 *
 *   This is the difference between "a kernel with a chatbot in it" and an
 *   operating system whose interface is natural language. The model has syscalls.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE
 *   Tools self-register through the linker, exactly like drivers do (driver.h).
 *   There is no central list to edit, which means a new tool family is a new .c
 *   file and nothing else — no shared file to serialise on:
 *
 *       static int my_tool(const tool_call_t *c, tool_result_t *r) { ... }
 *       static const tool_t my_tool_def = {
 *           .name         = "read_file",
 *           .description  = "Read a file from the filesystem.",
 *           .input_schema = "{\"type\":\"object\","
 *                           "\"properties\":{\"path\":{\"type\":\"string\"}},"
 *                           "\"required\":[\"path\"]}",
 *           .invoke       = my_tool,
 *       };
 *       REGISTER_TOOL(my_tool_def);
 *
 *   Add the source path to KERNEL_SRCS in the Makefile and it is live: exposed
 *   to the model in the request's "tools" array, and dispatchable by name.
 *
 * RESPONSIBILITIES
 *   - Registry: enumerate registered tools, look one up by name.
 *   - Schema assembly: build the "tools":[...] JSON array sent to the API, from
 *     the registered descriptors, so the advertised contract and the dispatch
 *     table can never drift apart.
 *   - Dispatch: route a tool_use block to its handler, enforce the result buffer
 *     bound, emit the trace line, and turn an unknown name into a legible error
 *     the model can recover from rather than a kernel fault.
 *
 * THE INPUT CONTRACT
 *   A handler receives the tool_use block's `input` object as a RAW JSON span
 *   (not a parsed structure), and reads fields with json.h. Raw is deliberate:
 *   every tool's arguments differ, the span costs no allocation, and json.h is
 *   already hardened and host-tested against malformed network data. Treat the
 *   span as untrusted — it is model output, and a confused model can send a path
 *   of 10,000 characters or a negative length.
 *
 * THE RESULT CONTRACT
 *   Handlers write plain text (or JSON text) into the caller-provided buffer via
 *   tool_result_printf. The text is what the model sees as the tool_result
 *   content, so it should be terse and factual — the model reasons over it. Set
 *   is_error on failure; the loop marks the block so the model knows the action
 *   did not happen and can try something else.
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES
 *   json.h (reading the input span, escaping output), trace.h (the ground-truth
 *   line), and whatever subsystem the individual tool drives. Nothing here
 *   depends on the transport, so the whole surface is testable against the mock
 *   in net/model_mock.c with no network.
 *
 * FUTURE EXTENSION POINTS
 *   `flags` carries per-tool policy. TOOL_MUTATES marks tools that change system
 *   state, which is the hook a future confirmation prompt or read-only mode would
 *   key off. Once processes and users exist, a permission field alongside it lets
 *   the same registry serve unprivileged callers. The screen tools (Phase 2), the
 *   fault-recovery tools (Phase 3), and the driver VM (Phase 4) all register here
 *   like any other tool — the loop never learns their names.
