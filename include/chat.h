/* chat.h — the agentic turn loop: one typed sentence -> real kernel actions.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   This is the machine's only interface. There is no shell, no command
 *   language, and there never will be: the operator types a sentence, and this
 *   module turns it into kernel work. It is the piece that joins the three
 *   contracts around it — tool.h (what the model may do), model.h (how bytes
 *   reach the model), json.h (how the protocol is read and written) — into a
 *   loop that keeps running until the machine has actually done the thing.
 *
 * THE LOOP
 *   One call to chat_ask() is one *turn*, and a turn is not one request. The
 *   model may answer with tool_use blocks instead of prose; those are real
 *   kernel calls, and their results have to go back so the model can carry on.
 *   So a turn is:
 *
 *       append the operator's sentence to the history
 *       repeat:
 *           build a request  = system prompt + tools[] + the whole history
 *           send it through the transport (model.h — never a named transport)
 *           print every text block                      <- the model's voice
 *           dispatch every tool_use block (tool.h)      <- the kernel acts,
 *                                                          and traces it
 *           if there were no tool_use blocks: the turn is done
 *           append the assistant turn verbatim, then a user turn carrying one
 *           tool_result per tool_use, keyed by tool_use_id, plus one kernel
 *           note telling the model how much of the round budget is left
 *       until CHAT_MAX_ROUNDS
 *
 *   The iteration cap is not a nicety. A model that keeps calling tools would
 *   otherwise own this machine forever; there is no scheduler to preempt it and
 *   no other console to kill it from.
 *
 * SOLVING, NOT ANSWERING — the properties the loop owes a working agent
 *   A cap alone makes the machine safe, not useful. Four things here are what
 *   make a multi-step job actually finish:
 *
 *     1. THE BUDGET IS VISIBLE. Every tool_result turn carries a kernel note
 *        ("tool round 3 of 16 used ..."). A model that cannot see the cap plans
 *        past it and gets cut off mid-job; one that can see it wraps up. On the
 *        last round the note says so in as many words, and the request is sent
 *        with tool calling switched off (tool_choice=none — NOT by dropping the
 *        schema, which the history still references), so the only continuation
 *        left is prose. That turns the cap from a silent death into a report.
 *     2. TRANSIENT FAILURE IS NOT FAILURE. A rate limit or a dropped TLS read
 *        used to throw away every completed action in the turn. Retryable
 *        outcomes (HTTP 429/503/529, timeouts, transport errors) are retried up
 *        to CHAT_SEND_RETRIES times per turn without spending a round, because
 *        the alternative is to discard real work that already happened.
 *     3. EVERY tool_use IS ANSWERED, ALWAYS. The API rejects a conversation in
 *        which a tool_use has no matching tool_result, so "the results did not
 *        fit" is not a truncation, it is the death of the whole exchange. The
 *        staging writer therefore gives each pending call a FAIR SHARE of the
 *        room left (see put_tool_result), and a round whose answers provably
 *        cannot fit is refused BEFORE any tool runs rather than after.
 *     4. THE KERNEL REMEMBERS WHAT IT RAN. chat_action_at() is a ring of the
 *        tool calls this machine actually dispatched, recorded by the loop from
 *        real dispatch results — not by the model, and not from the model's
 *        memory of them. It outlives history eviction and outlives an abandoned
 *        turn, which is what lets a model that was cut off pick the job back up
 *        instead of starting again. tools/agent_tools.c hands it to the model.
 *
 * CONVERSATION HISTORY — the bounded part
 *   Multi-turn tool use is unforgiving about shape. The assistant's tool_use
 *   turn must be echoed back *verbatim*, and it must be followed by a user turn
 *   whose tool_result blocks match it one-for-one by id. A history that loses
 *   half of such a pair is not "shorter", it is invalid, and the API rejects it.
 *
 *   Storage is therefore a single fixed arena of raw JSON message *contents*
 *   (CHAT_HISTORY_BYTES) plus a fixed index of at most CHAT_HISTORY_MSGS
 *   entries. Nothing grows; nothing is allocated per turn. Every entry carries
 *   the *epoch* — the operator turn — it belongs to, and three rules follow:
 *
 *     1. Eviction is whole epochs, oldest first. Dropping a complete exchange
 *        can never orphan a tool_result from its tool_use, and can never leave
 *        the history starting on an assistant message.
 *     2. The in-flight epoch is never evicted. If a single turn cannot fit on
 *        its own, that is CHAT_EHISTORY: the turn is abandoned and reported,
 *        not silently truncated into an invalid request.
 *     3. A turn that fails for *any* reason is rolled back in full. Only turns
 *        that ran to a final assistant message are remembered, so the stored
 *        history is always a valid, strictly alternating conversation.
 *
 *   The request buffer is a second, independent bound (CHAT_REQ_BYTES, sized to
 *   stay inside the TLS transport's own request framing buffer). If a request
 *   overflows it, the loop drops the oldest epoch and rebuilds rather than
 *   failing — so the machine degrades to a shorter memory instead of dying.
 *
 * WHAT THE OPERATOR SEES
 *   Prose is the model. [Brackets] are the kernel. Tool trace lines come from
 *   trace.h via tool_dispatch(), so they are emitted in C from real return
 *   values and cannot be forged by the model. This module's own bracket lines
 *   (transport failures, the iteration cap, history eviction) deliberately do
 *   NOT go through trace.h: trace_count() must stay an exact count of kernel
 *   actions the model caused, not of things the loop had to say.
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES
 *   model.h, tool.h, json.h, trace.h, kernel.h. No transport, no lwIP, no
 *   hardware — chat.c is compiled into the host test binary as-is and driven
 *   against net/model_mock.c, which is how the loop is tested with no network,
 *   no API key and no QEMU (tests/host/test_chat.c).
 *
 * FUTURE EXTENSION POINTS
 *   - Per-channel output: input_last_source() already says which console a
 *     sentence arrived on; routing this module's prose and trace lines there is
 *     a change of output function, not of shape.
 *   - Streaming: the loop reads whole response bodies today. A streaming
 *     transport would feed the same block walk incrementally.
 *   - Confirmation for TOOL_MUTATES tools slots into the dispatch step.
 *   - Spilling evicted epochs into the VFS would turn eviction into paging and
 *     give the machine a conversation that outlives its RAM budget.
 *   - The action journal is the natural place to hang a persisted audit log:
 *     the same entries appended to a VFS file would survive chat_init(), and
 *     (once the VFS has a disk behind it) a reboot.
 *   - The budget note is the only kernel voice inside the conversation. Cost
 *     accounting ("you have spent N tokens of context") would go in the same
 *     block, since it is the same class of fact: something only the loop knows.

 * of description and JSON Schema per tool. Overflowing it offers the model NO
 * tools at all, loudly, rather than advertising a contract it cannot read; that
 * is the right failure but it is a total one, so the bound is kept ahead of the
 * registry deliberately.
 *
 * THE CLIFF THIS WAS ON, and how it was paid for rather than shaved.
 * One request must hold this schema, the system prompt and the history (up to
 * CHAT_HISTORY_BYTES), inside CHAT_REQ_BYTES, which in turn must stay inside
 * net/net.c's HTTP framing buffer. At 49 tools those numbers were
 *
 *     39125 + 16384 + 4506 + 1400 = 61415 of CHAT_REQ_BYTES = 61440
 *
 * i.e. TWENTY-FIVE bytes of slack in the worst-case request, against a framing
 * buffer of 64 KiB. The paragraph that used to live here said, correctly, that
 * tool 50 could not be paid for by cutting prose again and that the STRUCTURE
 * had to change first: "send the schema once per conversation rather than once
 * per round, or page it, or grow net/net.c's framing buffer so CHAT_REQ_BYTES
 * can move."
 *
 * The network tool family (tools/net_tools.c, four verbs, ~3 KiB of schema) is
 * the change that needed it, and the third option is the one that was taken,
 * because it is the only one of the three that is a size change rather than a
 * protocol change:
 *
 *     net/net.c   TLS_REQ_BYTES   65536 -> 81920   (the framing buffer)
 *     here        CHAT_REQ_BYTES  61440 -> 77824
 *     here        CHAT_TOOLS_BYTES 40960 -> 49152
 *
 * AND IT HAD TO BE PAID AGAIN, ONCE, WITH THE MACHINE DEAD IN BETWEEN. Read this
 * before adding a tool family, because it is what the failure actually looks like.
 * A capability family (core/capability.c + tools/capability_tools.c, four verbs)
 * took the registry from 42909 to 49238 bytes — 86 bytes OVER CHAT_TOOLS_BYTES.
 * The overflow is not a truncation: net/chat.c's tools_load() sets tools_len = 0
 * and the model is then offered NO TOOLS AT ALL, so the machine boots, talks, and
 * can do nothing whatever. The boot banner read "57 registered (0 bytes of
 * schema)" and three QEMU cases failed on it. Eighty-six bytes is the whole
 * distance between a working agent and an inert one, which is the argument for
 * keeping real slack rather than the minimum that fits:
 *
 *     net/net.c   TLS_REQ_BYTES   81920 -> 90112
 *     here        CHAT_REQ_BYTES  77824 -> 86016
 *     here        CHAT_TOOLS_BYTES 49152 -> 57344
 *
 * The worst case is now 57344 + 16384 + 4506 + 1400 = 79634 of 86016, i.e. 6382
 * bytes of real slack in the request, with 8172 bytes spare inside
 * CHAT_TOOLS_BYTES itself; net/net.c carries a _Static_assert that its buffer
 * still holds CHAT_REQ_BYTES plus headers, so the two numbers cannot drift apart
 * silently the way this comment's predecessor did. The cost is ~24 KiB more BSS on
 * a machine with 128 MiB.
 *
 * WHAT THAT DOES NOT BUY. It buys ROOM, not a different design. The schema is
 * still retransmitted in full on every round of every turn, so the real cost of
 * tool 57 is paid in tokens and latency on every request, and the structural fix
 * (send it once, or page it) is still the right one. This is the SECOND time the
 * buffers have been grown to pay for a tool family, and growing them a third time
 * would be an admission that nobody intends to do the structural work: 57 tools
 * averaging 863 bytes of schema is already ~13k tokens on every single request, on
 * a machine whose whole point is a conversation. Read the two numbers below
 * together before adding a family: the binding limit is whichever is closer.
 *
 * WHERE THE REGISTRY ACTUALLY IS, so nobody re-derives it from a stale comment.
 * The boot banner prints the truth ("tools : N registered (M bytes of schema)"),
 * and that number lives in exactly one place in this tree — CHAT_REGISTRY_BYTES
 * below — which tests/host/test_app.c, tests/host/test_agency.c and
 * tests/qemu/harness.py all read, and which `make test-qemu` FAILS on if the
 * kernel disagrees with it.
 *
 * The version of this paragraph before last said 4008 bytes of slack, computed
 * from a CHAT_REGISTRY_BYTES that was 4 KiB stale — so the slack it advertised
 * had already been spent. Do not "fix" a red guard by raising a constant without
 * also raising the one below it in the chain; that is what the static assert in
 * net/net.c is there to stop. */

/* WHAT THE 45-TOOL REGISTRY ASSEMBLES TO TODAY, in bytes, measured.
 *
 * WHY A CONSTANT AND NOT A COMMENT. No host test links all 45 tools — each test
 * binary links the two or three families it exercises — so the only place the
 * real total exists is the boot banner, and the last three times it was written
 * down it was written as a literal inside a printf, in three files, and drifted
 * 699 bytes in the UNSAFE direction while every suite stayed green. The suites
 * were printing it as a measured fact and this header was pointing at them as
 * the authority, so the next agent sizing a description would have believed it
 * had 699 bytes it did not have.
 *
 * This is now one number with teeth: `make test-qemu` parses the banner and
 * FAILS if the kernel disagrees with it (tests/qemu/harness.py, tool_registry's
 * expect_schema_bytes). Growing a description is therefore a two-line change —
 * the description, and this — and forgetting the second line is loud rather
 * than silent. Get the new value from the banner, never by arithmetic on the
 * old one; that is precisely how the last drift happened. */

 * CHAT_REQ_BYTES. When this value was stale at 35142 those two guards were
 * passing on a number 4 KiB too small, so the overflow they exist to catch had
 * already happened and was invisible. Read the banner, set this, and if the

 * description gained the 200-byte paragraph saying that a program developed
 * under driver_run's /vm root is DENIED under a capability's data root, which

 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE ADDING ANYTHING: 57344 - 56309 leaves 1035 BYTES. Not 8 KiB,

 * either take it out of an existing one or make the case for the structural fix
 * this file has now asked for twice (send the schema once, or page it). The

 * results does NOT fit here and never did. What changed is who pays for that:
 * put_tool_result() now divides the room between the calls still waiting to be
