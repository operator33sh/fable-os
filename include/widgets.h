/* widgets.h — the widget toolkit: rectangles, layout, and the four controls a
 *             window is made of.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   An app on this machine is a window plus a handful of widgets plus one event
 *   hook. This header is the "plus a handful of widgets" part, and it is
 *   deliberately the SMALLER half of the GUI: gui.h owns windows, z-order, focus
 *   and the event loop; everything here is pure arithmetic over rectangles and
 *   pixels, with no static state at all beyond the theme.
 *
 *   That split is what makes the toolkit testable. A widget is a value in a
 *   window's fixed array; laying one out is a function from a rectangle to a
 *   rectangle; painting one is a function from a widget and a surface to pixels;
 *   hit-testing one is a comparison. tests/host/test_gui.c calls every one of
 *   those directly, against a malloc'd fb_surface_t, and asserts exact pixels
 *   and exact boundaries. Nothing here needs a framebuffer, a mouse or a boot.
 *
 * DESIGNED FOR A CALCULATOR FIRST
 *   The brief is "the operator says 'I want a calculator' and a working
 *   calculator appears", so the calculator drove the design and the general case
 *   was extracted from it rather than the other way round. Three consequences
 *   are visible in the API:
 *
 *     1. gui_grid() is exact, not approximate. A 4x5 keypad has to tile its area
 *        with no seams and no overlaps whatever the window size, including sizes
 *        that do not divide by four. So cell edges are computed as
 *        (avail * i) / n and each cell ends where the next one begins: adjacent
 *        cells share an edge to the pixel, widths differ by at most one, and the
 *        last cell ends exactly on the area's right edge. A layout that is one
 *        pixel out shows up as a visible seam and as a dead column between two
 *        buttons, which is a bug a model authoring an app cannot debug.
 *
 *     2. Spans exist (colspan/rowspan), because "=" is a double-width key and a
 *        display is a full-width one. A span is defined as "from the left edge of
 *        cell (col) to the right edge of cell (col+colspan-1)", so a spanning
 *        cell is exactly the union of the cells it covers plus the gaps between
 *        them — never a re-division of the area.
 *
 *     3. A widget's text is a fixed char array, not a pointer. A calculator's
 *        display changes on every keypress and the alternative is either an
 *        allocation per keystroke or a lifetime rule an app author will get
 *        wrong. GUI_TEXT_MAX is 40, which holds a 12-digit result with a sign, a
 *        decimal point and room to be wrong in.
 *
 * COORDINATE SPACES — there are exactly two, and mixing them is the classic bug
 *   SCREEN coordinates are pixels from the top-left of the framebuffer. A
 *   window's frame rectangle is in screen space.
 *   CLIENT coordinates are pixels from the top-left of a window's client area,
 *   i.e. inside the border and below the title bar. Every widget rectangle is in
 *   client space, so moving a window does not touch its widgets, and a widget can
 *   be laid out before its window is placed.
 *   gui.h converts between them in exactly one place (gui_client_rect()), and
 *   event delivery hands a widget hook coordinates relative to THE WIDGET.
 *
 * WHAT A WIDGET IS
 *   Four kinds, chosen as the smallest set that makes a real app:
 *     GUI_PANEL   a filled rectangle: a background, a group box, a separator.
 *                 Not hit-testable by default, so a panel behind a keypad cannot
 *                 swallow the keypad's clicks.
 *     GUI_LABEL   text, aligned left/centre/right, optionally over a fill.
 *     GUI_BUTTON  text in a raised box that sinks while held. Activation is
 *                 press-then-release-inside, like every other GUI: pressing and
 *                 dragging off cancels, which is the behaviour that makes a
 *                 misclick recoverable.
 *     GUI_FIELD   a sunken box holding editable text with a caret. Read-only
 *                 fields are the honest way to render a value the app owns (a
 *                 calculator display), and they are still selectable so a click
 *                 can focus the window without arming the keyboard.
 *
 *   Each carries `id` (app-assigned, 0 = anonymous), a state byte, colours, and
 *   an optional per-widget event hook. The hook is tried first and the window's
 *   hook second, so an app can either write one switch on widget ids (what the
 *   calculator does) or attach behaviour per control, without the toolkit having
 *   an opinion.
 *

 *   editing     gui_field_key gui_field_clear
 *   theme       gui_theme gui_set_theme gui_metrics
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES
 *   fb.h (surfaces, clipped drawing, the 0x00RRGGBB colour format) and font.h
 *   (the 8x16 font and UTF-8 measurement). Nothing else — no heap, no hardware,
 *   no console. gui.h includes this header, not the other way round.
 *
 * FUTURE EXTENSION POINTS
 *   - A new widget kind is a case in gui_paint_widget() plus a hit rule; the
 *     window's array does not change shape.
 *   - Hover state: the WM already computes the widget under the pointer for
 *     every motion event, so a GUI_W_HOT bit and one extra colour in the theme
 *     would light buttons up under the cursor with no new plumbing.
 *   - Scrolling and clipping to a viewport: fb_clip_set() intersects rather than
 *     replaces, so a container widget that narrows the clip before painting its
 *     children needs nothing from this header.
 *   - Proportional fonts: every measurement goes through gui_text_width(), which
 *     is the only place that assumes a fixed advance.
