/* dvm.h — the driver VM: a bounded machine the model can program.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   The end goal is a kernel that writes a device driver at runtime for hardware
 *   it has never heard of. The obvious way to do that — ask the model for x86-64
 *   machine code and jump to it — is the wrong way twice over: models are
 *   unreliable at raw encoding, and the failure mode is a silent triple fault
 *   with no story. There is nothing to read afterwards and nothing to blame.
 *
 *   So the model does not get the CPU. It gets THIS machine: a small register VM
 *   whose opcodes are exactly the primitives a bring-up sequence needs — port
 *   I/O, MMIO, PCI config reads, delays, compare-and-branch — and nothing else.
 *   There is no instruction that computes an address the VM does not check, no
 *   instruction that reaches kernel memory, and no instruction that runs forever.
 *   Every access is checked against an allowlist the CALLER supplies, and every
 *   instruction can be printed as a kernel-authored trace line.
 *
 *   That trade buys three things a native-code path cannot give:
 *     1. Containment. A confused program is refused, not fatal.
 *     2. A transcript. A failed bring-up leaves an exact list of the ports and
 *        registers it touched, in order, with the values it read back.
 *     3. Separability. When a program does not work you can tell whether the VM
 *        executed it wrongly or the program was wrong, because the VM's
 *        semantics are unit-tested on the host against a synthetic device.
 *
 * THE MACHINE
 *   16 general registers (r0-r15), 64-bit, unsigned. r0.. are preloaded from the
 *   caller's argument vector, which is how a program is handed the BAR address
 *   of the device it is supposed to drive instead of hardcoding one.
 *
 *   A data stack (PUSH/POP, 32 deep) and a separate call stack (CALL/RET, 16
 *   deep). Overflow or underflow of either is a trap, not a wrap.
 *
 *   Two flags, set by CMP and TEST, read by the six conditional branches.
 *   Comparisons are UNSIGNED: these are hardware values, not arithmetic.
 *
 *   SCRATCH MEMORY (below): DVM_MEM_SIZE bytes of byte-addressed working store
 *   in an address space of its own, plus the string operations that make it
 *   useful. A DMA buffer alone was enough to drive hardware and nothing else;
 *   the scratch arena is what lets a program hold, compare and build TEXT, and
 *   therefore what lets the model author something that is not a device driver.
 *
 * THE SCRATCH ARENA — the program's own memory, and why it is a second one
 *   The DMA buffer is memory the HARDWARE reads: its address is a physical
 *   address, it is granted per run, and whatever a program leaves in it is
 *   still being fetched by a DMA engine after the run ends. That makes it a
 *   terrible place to think in, and sharing it between "samples the codec is
 *   playing" and "the HTTP header I am parsing" would put the two one bug
 *   apart.
 *
 *   So there is a second region with the opposite properties:
 *
 *     - It is addressed by OFFSET, 0 .. DVM_MEM_SIZE-1, not by address. There
 *       is no arithmetic in the ISA that turns an offset into a machine
 *       address, so a scratch access cannot reach kernel memory even in
 *       principle: the worst a wrong offset can do is trap.
 *     - It is ZEROED at the start of every dvm_run(), so one program can never
 *       read what another left. Nothing can seed it either; the only ways bytes
 *       get in are the program's own instructions and a syscall's output.
 *       (A caller may READ it afterwards with dvm_mem_peek() — that is how a
 *       program returns more than sixteen registers' worth of answer.)
 *       This is why dvm_run() REFUSES to be re-entered with
 *       DVM_TRAP_REENTRY: there is one arena, it is zeroed at entry, so a
 *       nested run would erase the outer program's working store mid-execution
 *       and every later mld would silently read zeros. See dvm_run().
 *     - No device can see it. It is not the DMA arena, it is never handed to
 *       hardware, and mld/mst never perform a bus cycle.
 *     - Every access is bounds-checked against DVM_MEM_SIZE, and the total
 *       number of BYTES the memory and string instructions touch is bounded by
 *       max_mem_bytes — because one `mcpy` is one instruction and 64 KiB of
 *       work, so the step budget alone would not bound it.
 *
 *   Unlike MMIO, scratch accesses need no alignment: mld32 at offset 1 is a
 *   little-endian byte gather. Device registers need alignment because the bus
 *   does; memory does not, and an alignment trap in the middle of parsing a
 *   header would be a cost with nothing bought.
 *
 * STRINGS ARE SPANS, NEVER C STRINGS
 *   A string in this machine is two register values: an offset and a LENGTH.
 *   Nothing is NUL-terminated, nothing scans for a terminator, and no
 *   instruction's bound comes from the data it is reading — the length is
 *   always supplied and always checked against DVM_MEM_SIZE first. That is a
 *   deliberate refusal to import C string semantics into a sandbox whose input
 *   is model output.
 *
 *   Because a span is just two numbers, SLICING needs no instruction: the
 *   second half of a span is (off+n, len-n), which is `add`. What does need
 *   instructions is everything that touches the bytes, and those are the `m`
 *   family: mstr (write a literal), mcpy (copy, overlap-safe), mset (fill),
 *   mcmp (compare, sets the flags), mfind (find a literal), mchr (find a byte),
 *   matoi (digits -> value) and mitoa (value -> digits). Every one of them that
 *   writes returns the END offset of what it wrote, so building a message is a
 *   chain: mstr, mcpy, mitoa, mstr, each starting where the last one stopped.
 *
 * SYSCALLS — the deliberate holes, enumerated
 *   `sys` is the only instruction that reaches the kernel. Arguments are PUSHed
 *   onto the data stack in order and popped by the call, so arity varies
 *   without a wider instruction; the result lands in the destination register
 *   and the ZERO FLAG says whether it succeeded. Every syscall is denied by
 *   default: dvm_policy_allow_sys() opens exactly one, and there is no "allow
 *   all". What each one validates before the kernel sees it is written next to
 *   dvm_sys_nr_t. In one line each:
 *
 *     con.write   spans checked, bytes forced to printable ASCII, length
 *                 capped, counted against max_prints. It goes out as a kernel
 *                 trace line, so the '[' in column zero is still the kernel's.
 *     fs.read     path built from a checked span: absolute, printable, bounded,
 *     fs.write    no "." or ".." component, and inside the policy's fs_root.
 *     fs.size     The destination/source spans are checked like any other.
 *     audio.tone  frequency and duration range-checked here, not in audio.c.
 *     time.ms     no arguments, no state, reads the millisecond clock.
 *     net.fetch   url span (off,len) + dst span (off,cap). Fetches the URL
 *                 and writes the response body to scratch at dst_off,
 *                 NUL-terminated. Returns the HTTP status code (200, 404, …)
 *                 or a negative FETCH_E* transport error code. Arity 4:
 *                 url_off, url_len, dst_off, dst_cap.
 *
 *   THE HONEST PART, again. fs.write is a real hole: a program that may write
 *   files can rewrite something a later turn will read and believe. fs_root is
 *   what bounds it, and a caller that sets fs_root to "/" has given the program
 *   the whole filesystem. There is no network syscall, not because it would be
 *   safe to add, but because this kernel has no synchronous fetch to call.
 *
 *   The one thing NO syscall does is hand the program an address. Buffers cross
 *   the boundary as (offset, length) into the scratch arena, resolved and
 *   bounds-checked by the VM; dvm_sys_t sees kernel pointers it can trust and
 *   never a number the program chose.
 *
 * THE DMA SCRATCH BUFFER — the one memory grant, and what it really costs
 *   A driver that only pokes registers can reset a codec. It can never play a
 *   sound, because every DMA engine on the machine is told where to work by
 *   being handed a PHYSICAL ADDRESS, and a machine with no memory has no
 *   address to give. So the VM has exactly one memory region:
 *
 *       dvm_dma_region()          -> the arena this module owns, once, forever
 *       dvm_policy_allow_dma()    -> grant all or part of it to one run
 *       on entry: DVM_ARG_DMA_BASE and DVM_ARG_DMA_SIZE hold base and bytes
 *       ld8/ld16/ld32, st8/st16/st32 reach it, exactly as they reach MMIO
 *
 *   The arena is a single static, page-aligned DVM_DMA_SIZE-byte array inside
 *   vm/dvm.c. It is not the heap, not the stack, and not part of any other
 *   subsystem's memory; the low 4 GiB is identity-mapped, so its virtual
 *   address IS its physical address and a 32-bit bus master can reach it.
 *   dvm_policy_allow_dma() refuses any range that is not a subrange of THAT
 *   array — the caller supplies no address of its own, so a caller bug cannot
 *   open a window on kernel memory either. Accesses to it are bounds-checked,
 *   alignment-checked and counted against their own budget (max_dma_ops), kept
 *   separate from max_io so that filling a second of PCM does not consume the
 *   device-access budget a bring-up needs.
 *
 *   THE HONEST PART. This is a real escalation of privilege and there is no
 *   point pretending otherwise. The VM bounds what the PROGRAM touches. It
 *   cannot bound what the HARDWARE does once the program has written an address
 *   into a device's DMA register. There is no IOMMU on this machine. A device
 *   handed a wrong physical address will DMA over kernel memory, and no
 *   instruction check anywhere in this file can see it happen.
 *
 *   What is actually mitigated:
 *     - only the ONE named target gets PCI bus mastering, and the C dispatcher
 *       (tools/dvm_tools.c) sets that bit, not the program: there is still no
 *       config-space WRITE in the ISA;
 *     - the program is told exactly one valid buffer address and one size;
 *     - the arena is its own object, far from the heap's live blocks, so a
 *       device that overruns the buffer by a little damages only scratch;
 *     - every value the program writes into a device register appears in the
 *       access log, so the address it handed the device is on the record.
 *
 *   What is NOT mitigated: a determined program can compute any 32-bit number
 *   and write it into a device's descriptor-base register. Nothing here stops
 *   it. That is the same trust every real kernel extends to a driver it loads,
 *   and it is the reason the buffer is granted per-run by a C caller that names
 *   the device, rather than being a standing capability.

 *
 *   log         print "text"
 *               print "text", a          appends "= 0x..." with a's value
 *
 * SOURCE SYNTAX
 *   One instruction per line. Comments run from `;`, `#` or `//` to the end of
 *   the line (so `#5` is a comment, not an ARM-style immediate). Commas between
 *   operands are optional. Mnemonics, register names and labels are
 *   case-insensitive. A label is `name:` on its own line or before an
 *   instruction. Numbers may be decimal, 0x hex, 0b binary, negative, or contain
 *   `_` separators. `.equ NAME value` (also spelled `.def` / `.set`) defines a
 *   constant usable anywhere a number is, which is how a program says
 *   `AC97_RESET` instead of `0x2c`.
 *
 *   Two-operand ALU forms are accepted as shorthand (`add r1, 4` means
 *   `add r1, r1, 4`), the address of an MMIO op may be written `[r1+0x10]`,
 *   `[r1]`, `[0xfebc0000]` or as two plain operands, and a PCI bdf may be
 *   written the way pci_list prints it (`00:03.0`). The assembler is forgiving
 *   on purpose: the model writes this text, and a rejected program costs a turn.
 *
 * CONTAINMENT — what a hostile or confused program CANNOT do
 *   Nothing is reachable by default. dvm_policy_init() produces a deny-all
 *   policy and the caller opens exactly the windows the target device needs:
 *
 *       dvm_policy_t pol;
 *       dvm_policy_init(&pol);
 *       dvm_policy_allow_ports(&pol, 0xC000, 0xC03F);          // this BAR only
 *       dvm_policy_allow_mmio (&pol, 0xFEBC0000, 0x20000, DVM_MMIO_RW);
 *       dvm_policy_allow_pci  (&pol, 0, 4, 0);                 // one function
 *       dvm_policy_allow_dma  (&pol, dma_base, dma_size);      // the scratch arena
 *
 *   On top of the allowlist there is a DENY list compiled into vm/dvm.c that no
 *   caller can override: the PICs, the PIT (millis() is calibrated against it),
 *   the PS/2 controller (port 0x64 can pulse the CPU reset line), CMOS/NMI, the
 *   fast-A20/reset port, the PCI config address/data ports (writes there move a
 *   live device's BAR), the serial console (the only place this trace is
 *   printed), and all of low memory up to the end of the kernel image — which is
 *   also what keeps the program off the VGA text buffer at 0xB8000, since page 0
 *   and the framebuffer share a 2 MiB huge page and cannot be unmapped. MMIO
 *   above 4 GiB is refused too: only the low 4 GiB is mapped, so an access there
 *   would be a page fault rather than a refusal.
 *
 *   The deny list is applied twice: once when the run starts, so a policy that
 *   overlaps it is refused outright with a message naming the conflict, and
 *   again on every access, so a bug in policy validation cannot become a poke at
 *   the PIC.
 *
 *   The DMA arena is the ONE exception to "all memory below the kernel top is
 *   denied", and it is not a hole in that rule so much as a different object:
 *   the address is not supplied by the caller at all. dvm_policy_allow_dma()
 *   compares the request against this module's own static array and refuses
 *   anything else, so the only way to widen the grant is to edit vm/dvm.c.
 *
 *   The scratch arena is not a hole in "all memory below the kernel top is
 *   denied" either, for a stronger reason than the DMA arena: it is not in that
 *   address space at all. mld/mst take an OFFSET, the offset is compared
 *   against DVM_MEM_SIZE, and the resulting pointer is formed by the VM from
 *   its own array. No policy governs it because no policy could widen it.
 *
 *   Syscalls are deny-all and opened one at a time by dvm_policy_allow_sys().
 *   A program with no syscalls granted cannot reach the kernel at all, which is
 *   what dvm_policy_init() leaves behind.
 *
 *   Everything else is a budget, all of them enforced per run:
 *     max_steps      instructions executed  (this is the cycle limit; a program
 *                    that loops forever stops here with DVM_TRAP_STEPS)
 *     max_io         port + MMIO + PCI accesses (NOT DMA-buffer accesses)
 *     max_dma_ops    ld/st into the DMA scratch buffer
 *     max_mem_bytes  BYTES touched by the scratch-memory and string ops. Not a
 *                    count of instructions: `mcpy` is one instruction and up to
 *                    64 KiB of work, and `mfind` is one instruction and up to
 *                    len*needle byte comparisons, so the budget has to be
 *                    denominated in bytes or it does not bound anything. It is
 *                    charged as the work happens, so a long search stops in the
 *                    middle rather than after.
 *     max_sys        syscalls
 *     max_delay_us   cumulative microseconds spent in DELAY
 *     max_single_delay_us  the largest one DELAY may request
 *     max_prints     PRINT lines, and con.write calls
 *     max_trace      trace lines, after which tracing goes quiet (once, loudly)
 *
 *   And the structural bounds, checked by the assembler and re-checked by
 *   dvm_program_validate() before every run so a corrupted or hand-built program
 *   cannot escape either: every opcode known, every register index < 16, every
 *   branch target inside the program, every string index inside the pool.
 *
 * MMIO READS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS
 *   Many device registers are clear-on-read. That is why a read needs an
 *   allowlist at all, why DVM_MMIO_R and DVM_MMIO_W are separate bits (a caller
 *   can hand out a read-only window), and why the window granularity is a BAR
 *   rather than "all MMIO".
 *
 * DELAY
 *   The operand is MICROseconds. The hardware backend spends the whole-
 *   millisecond part in mdelay() and the remainder in a TSC spin calibrated once
 *   against millis(); if that calibration cannot be trusted the remainder
 *   degrades to a short bounded spin. So DELAY is a floor with millisecond-grade
 *   accuracy, not a precise timer. Bring-up code should poll with a counted
 *   retry loop and treat DELAY as backoff, which is also what makes a program
 *   deterministic under test.
 *
 * PUBLIC API
 *   dvm_assemble()          text -> dvm_program_t, with line-numbered errors
 *   dvm_program_validate()  structural re-check (run does this itself)
 *   dvm_disasm()            one instruction back to text, for listings
 *   dvm_policy_init()       deny-all policy + default budgets
 *   dvm_policy_allow_*()    open one port range / MMIO window / PCI function
 *   dvm_dma_region()        the one DMA scratch arena this module owns
 *   dvm_policy_allow_dma()  grant all or part of it to one run
 *   dvm_policy_allow_sys()  open one syscall
 *   dvm_policy_set_fs_root() the subtree fs.* syscalls are confined to
 *   dvm_mem_peek()          read the scratch arena after a run
 *   dvm_sys_name()          "fs.read", ... for a message or a trace line
 *   dvm_run()               execute; returns dvm_status_t, fills dvm_result_t
 *   dvm_status_name()       symbolic status for a message or a trace line
 *   dvm_io_hardware()       the real-hardware backend (NULL on a host build)
 *   dvm_sys_kernel()        the real syscall backend (NULL on a host build)
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES
 *   trace.h for the execution trace, and the libc shim's snprintf. No heap: the
 *   VM allocates nothing, ever, and the caller owns the dvm_program_t. Hardware
 *   is reached only through dvm_io_t, which is why the whole ISA is testable on
 *   a host against a synthetic device (tests/host/test_dvm.c).
 *
 * SIZE NOTE
 *   The DMA arena adds DVM_DMA_SIZE bytes of .bss to any kernel that links this
 *   file, and the scratch arena a further DVM_MEM_SIZE. Both are static and
 *   always present, because a buffer that is sometimes there is a buffer no
 *   program can rely on.
 *
 *   dvm_program_t is ~12 KB (256 instructions plus the label and string tables).
 *   The kernel stack is 64 KiB and shared with lwIP and mbedTLS — make one
 *   static or kmalloc it, do not put it on the stack. dvm_policy_t (~300 bytes)
 *   and dvm_result_t (~400 bytes) are stack-sized on purpose.
 *
 * FUTURE EXTENSION POINTS
 *   - The tool wrapper (next phase) hands the model dvm_assemble + dvm_run with
 *     a policy derived from the target device's BARs, so the model can never
 *     name a window the device does not own.
 *   - A program that completes successfully is a driver: keeping the assembled
 *     dvm_program_t and re-running its "service" entry point on demand is how a
 *     model-authored driver becomes persistent. Entry-point support wants one
 *     more field here (a label -> pc map is already retained for listings).
 *   - The deny list is deliberately not policy-overridable. If a legitimate use
 *     ever needs the PS/2 controller, the right change is an explicit unsafe
 *     opt-in flag with its own trace line, not a hole in the table.
 *   - Writes to PCI config space are absent for the same reason dev_tools.c
 *     refuses them; if they are ever added they belong behind a per-offset
 *     allowlist plus a restore path, as a new opcode with its own budget. The
 *     ONE config write a DMA driver needs — the bus-master bit — is done by the
 *     C dispatcher instead (tools/dvm_tools.c), which is why the ISA still has
 *     no way to move a live BAR.
 *   - An IOMMU (VT-d) is the only thing that would turn the DMA grant from
 *     trust into containment: a domain whose only mapping is the arena would
 *     make a wrong descriptor address a fault instead of corruption. Until then
 *     the honest description of the DMA path is "trusted driver", not "sandbox".
 *   - A second concurrent grant (two devices DMAing out of disjoint halves of
 *     the arena) needs the policy to carry a list rather than one range. The
 *     single-range shape is deliberate while exactly one program runs at a time,
 *     which dvm_run() now ENFORCES (DVM_TRAP_REENTRY) rather than assuming — it
 *     was assumed for a while, and a syscall serviced by a second program was
 *     quietly falsifying it.
 *   - A network syscall has been added as DVM_SYS_NET_FETCH: one hook in
 *     dvm_sys_t (net_fetch), one entry in dvm_sys_nr_t, arity 4.  The kernel
 *     backend calls fetch() from net/fetch.c; host test builds leave the hook
 *     NULL, which the VM turns into DVM_TRAP_NOIO as with any absent service.
 *   - Scratch memory is one flat arena because one program runs at a time. If
 *     that ever stops being true it wants a per-run window (base+size) rather
 *     than a second array, so that "offset" keeps meaning the same thing.

 * SIZE. 48 kHz stereo 16-bit PCM — the format every PC audio codec since AC'97
 * accepts without resampling — costs 48000 * 2 channels * 2 bytes = 187.5 KiB
 * per second. 256 KiB is the next power of two above that: it holds 1.09 s of
 * audio, which is long enough that a human hears a TONE rather than a click and
 * long enough that a polled kernel can watch a position counter advance, and it
 * still leaves ~68 KiB for whatever descriptor list, ring or command buffer the
 * device wants alongside the samples. A power of two also means any aligned
 * sub-buffer a program carves out of it stays inside it.
 *
 * ALIGNMENT. 4096 bytes. Alignment is not cosmetic to a DMA engine: hardware
 * commonly ignores the low bits of a descriptor-base register instead of
 * faulting on them, so an under-aligned buffer does not produce an error, it
 * produces DMA at a *different address* — which on this machine means DMA into
 * whatever is below the buffer. One page is the strongest alignment a PCI
 * function's base-address register is architecturally permitted to require, and
 * it is a multiple of every weaker one that real audio hardware asks for (8 for
 * an AC'97 buffer-descriptor list, 128 for an HD Audio BDL/CORB/RIRB, 64 for a
 * cache line, 32 for a scatter-gather entry). Being page-aligned also means the
 * arena's physical address has 12 zero low bits, so a device that truncates the
 * address it is given still lands on the buffer's start. */
