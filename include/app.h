/* app.h — the app runtime: the model writes a document, a real program appears.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   The operator types "hey I want a calculator" and a working calculator has to
 *   appear on screen. gui.h already provides windows, widgets, hit testing and an
 *   event loop, and gui/gui_demo.c proves a calculator can be built on top of them
 *   — in C, compiled in, by a human. This header is the part that removes the
 *   human: it defines WHAT AN APP IS when the model authors one at runtime, and
 *   the runtime (apps/runtime.c, apps/expr.c) that turns such a document into
 *   widgets, behaviour, and a window that can be clicked.
 *
 *   An app is a DOCUMENT, not code. It is parsed by net/json.c, validated in
 *   full before a single pixel is drawn, and executed by a total, bounded
 *   evaluator that cannot loop, cannot allocate, cannot fault and cannot reach
 *   anything but its own window.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION 1 — WHY A DECLARATIVE DOCUMENT AND NOT CODE
 * ============================================================================
 *   Three candidates were real:
 *
 *     (a) THE MODEL EMITS C, OR MACHINE CODE. Rejected for the same reason
 *         dvm.h rejects it for drivers: there is no compiler on this machine, and
 *         the failure mode of a wrong jump on a single-threaded ring-0 kernel
 *         with all pages RWX is a triple fault with nothing to read afterwards.
 *
 *     (b) THE MODEL EMITS A PROGRAM FOR vm/dvm.c, the existing bounded VM. This
 *         was the strong candidate in the brief and it was examined closely,
 *         because reusing a sandbox is nearly always right. It was rejected on
 *         the VM's own contract, not on taste:
 *
 *           - dvm's opcodes ARE hardware primitives — in8/out8, MMIO loads,
 *             PCI config reads, delay. Not one of them can read or write a
 *             widget's text, which is the only thing an app's logic does. Using
 *             it would mean adding widget opcodes to vm/dvm.c, i.e. changing the
 *             ISA whose whole value is that it is small, allowlisted and already
 *             fuzzed against a synthetic device.
 *           - "No writable data memory" is a stated containment property of that
 *             VM. A calculator needs a display STRING and an accumulator. There
 *             is nowhere to put them.
 *           - Its values are unsigned 64-bit machine words with unsigned
 *             comparisons ("these are hardware values, not arithmetic"). A
 *             calculator needs signed fixed point, a decimal point, and text
 *             formatting.
 *           - Its trace is per-instruction device access. An app runs a handler
 *             on every click; that trace would be noise, and the kernel's
 *             ground-truth line for an app is "this widget was clicked and the
 *             display now reads 12".
 *
 *         Two sandboxes with different jobs is the honest outcome. dvm.h drives
 *         hardware the kernel has never seen; this drives a window. They share
 *         the design (bounded, allowlisted, refuse rather than guess, every
 *         failure legible) and not one line of code.
 *
 *     (c) A DECLARATIVE DOCUMENT plus a tiny expression language. Chosen.
 *         The whole document arrives through net/json.c, which is hardened,
 *         fuzzed, ASan-clean and already trusted with network data, so the
 *         attack surface facing model output is a parser that was attacked
 *         first. Layout is data (a grid), so it cannot be "wrong" in a way that
 *         corrupts anything — only in a way that looks bad. And the ONLY place
 *         real logic is needed — what a button does — is a small language with
 *         no loops, no functions, no memory and no I/O.
 *
 *   WHAT THE EXPRESSION LANGUAGE DELIBERATELY CANNOT DO. There is no loop and no
 *   recursion, so a handler's cost is bounded by its own length before it runs.
 *   There is no way to name a widget in another window, no way to open or close a
 *   window, no way to print to the console (which also means model-authored text
 *   can never put a '[' in column zero and forge a kernel trace line — see
 *   trace.h), no way to read the filesystem, memory or a device, and no way to
 *   call a tool. An expression is arithmetic and text, and nothing else.
 *
 *   The one thing an app CAN now reach outside its own window is a named
 *   capability, and it is a STATEMENT rather than an expression precisely so that
 *   the property above survives: see DECISION 4. Everything else stays a syscall
 *   the model makes itself, where it is traced.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION 1b — WHAT A PERSON ACTUALLY ASKS FOR, AND WHAT THAT COST
 * ============================================================================
 *   The format above ran a calculator. The question that decided every addition
 *   below was the honest one: enumerate the apps somebody asks a computer for in
 *   one sentence, and check each against the format.
 *
 *     hello window, counter, tip calculator, unit/temperature converter, BMI,
 *     score keeper, shopping total, quiz          — EXPRESSIBLE ALREADY
 *     todo list (N fixed rows)                    — expressible, clumsily
 *     stopwatch, countdown timer, clock, alarm,
 *     pomodoro, anything that animates            — needed A PERIODIC EVENT
 *     clock, alarm, "what's the date"             — needed THE WALL CLOCK
 *     dice, coin flip, password, magic 8-ball,
 *     "guess the number", random picker           — needed RANDOMNESS
 *     tip / BMI / converter, shown to 2 decimals  — needed ROUNDING
 *     password, picking a character out of a set  — needed at()
 *     colour picker, progress bar, traffic light  — set "name.fg"/"name.bg" in
 *                                                   a handler to change colours
 *     todo list you can delete from, any list     — STILL MISSING: a list widget
 *
 *   So five additions, each of which unlocks a family rather than one app:
 *   a "tick" event, `now`, the wall clock, `rand()`, `at()` and `round()`. The
 *   list widget is still missing and needs new gui.h support; colour control
 *   is now a language feature (see "fg"/"bg" in widget keys and set syntax).
 *
 *   NONE OF THEM MAKES THIS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, and that is the constraint
 *   they were designed against — a declarative document has to stay cheap to
 *   validate and safe to accept from a model:
 *
 *     - "tick" IS NOT A LOOP. A tick handler is the same bounded statement list a
 *       click runs, with the same APP_MAX_STEPS budget, run at most once per
 *       app_tick() call and never more often than APP_TICK_MIN_MS. app_tick()
 *       NEVER CATCHES UP: the next due time is computed from the reading it just
 *       took, so a handler delayed by ten seconds runs once, not a hundred times.
 *       At most APP_MAX_TICKS handlers per app can be periodic, so the work a
 *       document can demand per period is a number this header states.
 *     - `now`, `clock`, `today`, `hour`, `minute`, `second` are LEAVES, not
 *       calls: they read a snapshot taken once when the event began, so they
 *       cannot poll, cannot block, and cannot disagree with each other inside one
 *       handler. The wall clock is sampled at most once per event and only if the
 *       document mentions it.
 *     - `rand(n)` is one 64-bit draw and a multiply — no rejection loop, so no
 *       input can make it iterate. It reuses the machine's existing entropy
 *       source (lib/libc_shim.c's mbedtls_hardware_poll: RDRAND, TSC fallback).
 *     - `at(s,i)` and `round(x)` are pure, total, constant-time, and produce ERR
 *       instead of trapping, exactly like every operator that came before.
 *
 *   An app is therefore still a bounded function from (event, time snapshot,
 *   entropy, its own widgets) to its own widgets' text.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION 2 — ERRORS ARE VALUES, SO EVALUATION IS TOTAL
 * ============================================================================
 *   A calculator must survive 1/0 and 999999999*999999999. The usual answers are
 *   to trap (the handler dies half-done, leaving the display holding a lie) or to
 *   wrap (the display holds a different lie). Instead there is a third value
 *   kind: ERR. Division by zero, overflow, num("abc") and arithmetic on a string
 *   all produce ERR; ERR propagates through every operator; text(ERR) is the word
 *   "error"; iserr(x) detects it. So no operation can fail, every handler runs to
 *   completion, and an app can latch a visible error state on purpose.
 *
 *   That is what makes the shipped calculator (apps/examples/calculator.json)
 *   able to say "error" and mean it, with no error handling in the runtime at
 *   all beyond a counter for the record.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION 3 — VALIDATE EVERYTHING BEFORE ANY PIXEL
 * ============================================================================
 *   A document is compiled in full — every widget placed, every expression
 *   parsed, every name resolved, every bound checked — into a reserved instance
 *   slot, and only then is a window opened. A rejected document therefore leaves
 *   NOTHING behind: no window, no partial widget set, no slot. That is what makes
 *   the retry loop work: the tool answers with the exact JSON path, the reason,
 *   and (for an expression) the byte offset, the model fixes that one thing, and
 *   the second attempt is a fresh launch rather than a repair.
 *
 *   Every limit below is a static bound with a message that names it, because
 *   "too big" without a number costs the model another turn.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION 4 — AN APP MAY CALL A CAPABILITY, AND THE KERNEL BROKERS EVERY ONE
 * ============================================================================
 *   Apps were sealed off from every driver and service on the machine: a
 *   model-built metronome could not tick audibly and a calculator could not beep.
 *   Real operating systems let an app ask the kernel for the hardware, so this
 *   format now has one more statement:
 *
 *     {"call":"audio.tone","with":{"hz":"440","ms":"120"},"into":"status"}
 *
 *   THE SHAPE, and why each part is the way it is:
 *     - "call" NAMES A CAPABILITY out of a static table (apps/cap.c). It is not a
 *       function name, a device, a path or an address — there is nothing in the
 *       format that can express any of those. A name that is not in the table is
 *       refused at LOAD time, with the whole table listed.
 *     - "with" is an object of EXPRESSION STRINGS, exactly like a `set`'s "to".
 *       That is the one syntactic decision that matters for extension: arguments
 *       are the same thing everywhere in this format, so "hz":"base * 2" works,
 *       nothing new had to be added to the language, and a future capability
 *       needs no format change at all — only a row in the table.
 *     - "into" is optional and names a var or widget that receives the OUTCOME:
 *       "ok" once the call really happened, or the sentence saying why not. So an
 *       app can display its own failure ("no audio driver is registered") instead
 *       of looking broken.
 *     - it is a STATEMENT, never an expression. Expressions stay pure, total and
 *       side-effect-free, which is what makes them safe to evaluate anywhere.
 *
 *   THE CAPABILITIES, AND THE BOUND ON EACH. One family exists today; the table
 *   is the enumeration, and apps/cap.c generates this list for the model too, so
 *   the documented bounds and the enforced bounds are the same numbers:
 *
 *     audio.tone   play one tone through whatever driver registered as the sink
 *       hz    REQUIRED. 0 (a deliberate rest) or AUDIO_HZ_MIN..AUDIO_HZ_MAX
 *             (20..20000). A 20 GHz tone is REFUSED, not clamped: a clamped
 *             request would report a sound that is not the one that was asked
 *             for, and a refusal that names the range is what lets a model fix
 *             itself next turn.
 *       ms    optional, default 120. 1..APP_CAP_AUDIO_MS_MAX (200). A 10-hour
 *             tone is refused by this bound. It is far below audio.h's own
 *             AUDIO_MAX_MS (1000) on purpose — see NOT STALLING THE MACHINE.
 *       amp   optional, default 0 = the kernel's own level. 0..AUDIO_AMP_MAX.
 *       wave  optional, default 'sine'. 'sine', 'square' or 'triangle' — an
 *             enumerated set, so no string from a document reaches a driver.
 *
 *     RATE: at most one sound is started per APP_CAP_GAP_MS (500 ms)
 *     machine-wide, and at most one request is in flight. A document asking for
 *     ten thousand tones a second therefore gets two a second and 9998 refusals,
 *     each with a sentence it can display. The refusals are counted in
 *     app_stats() and the last one is app_last_error().
 *
 *   THIS VALIDATION IS THE SECURITY BOUNDARY, AND THERE IS NO MMU BEHIND IT.
 *   State that plainly, because everything above reads like ordinary argument
 *   checking and it is not: this kernel is single-threaded and ring-0 only, with
 *   no privilege separation, no userspace, no memory protection and every page
 *   mapped RWX. A document is model output being interpreted by code with exactly
 *   the same authority as the driver it is asking for. There is no second line of
 *   defence under apps/cap.c — no page fault waiting to catch a bad number, no
 *   ring transition, no IOMMU. If a value from a document reached a driver
 *   unchecked, the only thing between it and the hardware would be that driver's
 *   own opinion of it. Which is why the format cannot name a driver, cannot pass
 *   a pointer, and cannot express an argument that is not a bounded number or one
 *   of an enumerated set of words.
 *
 *   NOT STALLING THE MACHINE. The event loop is polled, single-threaded, and the
 *   same loop serves the operator's prompt. So a handler never performs a call:
 *   app_cap_request() validates it and QUEUES it, and app_service() is the only
 *   code in apps/ that reaches a driver. A click therefore costs the same
 *   arithmetic time it did before this existed.
 *
 *   No sound starts while the machine is inside a model turn — and that is now a
 *   property of the call graph rather than a hope, which it briefly was not. The
 *   pump is reached only from app_tick(), and app_tick() belongs to the IDLE loop;
 *   kernel/main.c's ui fiber, which net/net.c yields to on every pass of every
 *   network wait, calls app_tick_handlers() instead and so cannot perform
 *   hardware. When those were one function, capability calls fired inside TLS
 *   round trips.
 *
 *   The honest remainder: audio.h's play contract is SYNCHRONOUS, because the
 *   kernel refills the one PCM buffer for the next sound and cannot ask a device
 *   where it is reading. So the drain blocks — for the length of the sound with a
 *   native sink, and for LONGER than that when the sink is a driver program, whose
 *   polling budget is the sound plus AUDIO_PLAY_MARGIN_US. APP_CAP_AUDIO_MS_MAX
 *   bounds what an app may ASK for; what bounds the stall is apps/cap.c measuring
 *   each call and keeping the machine quiet for at least that long again
 *   afterwards, so app sounds can never take as much as half of it. The prompt
 *   provably keeps answering (a sentence typed while a 120 ms sound repeats every
 *   second is echoed and answered between two sounds — measured, on a boot).
 *
 *   What that window really costs, stated because it is the sharpest edge here:
 *   input arriving DURING it is only as safe as the hardware's own buffer. A
 *   16550's FIFO is 16 bytes and the 8042's is one, so on real hardware a burst
 *   typed inside a 200 ms stall can be dropped by the UART rather than by this
 *   code. Under QEMU the chardev backend applies backpressure instead, so nothing
 *   is lost there and a test cannot see the difference — which is exactly why the
 *   bound is a small number and why this paragraph exists. A sound that is
 *   genuinely started and left running needs a start/poll split in the audio
 *   service, which is a change to that module and is listed under FUTURE
 *   EXTENSION POINTS.
 *
 *   EVERY PERFORMED CALL EMITS A KERNEL TRACE LINE. An app is model-authored, so
 *   the operator's only evidence is the same bracketed ground truth a tool call
 *   produces:
 *
 *       [app_call cap=audio.tone app=5 hz=440 ms=120 amp=8000 wave=sine -> ok]
 *
 *   Every field comes from kernel source or from a number the broker validated;
 *   the sink's own failure sentence is deliberately NOT in the line, because it
 *   can contain model bytes (a VM play program's `abort "reason"`). It reaches the
 *   app through "into" and app_last_error() instead, with control characters and
 *   brackets replaced — a reason of "\n[vfs_write -> ok]" must not be able to
 *   forge a kernel line anywhere. A REFUSED call touches no hardware and prints
 *   nothing: it is counted, and reported through "into" and app action=state, so
 *   that a document with a tick handler cannot fill the console with refusals.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE DOCUMENT FORMAT
 * ============================================================================
 *   {
 *     "title":  "Calculator",           // window title, optional
 *     "width":  216, "height": 266,     // client-ish size in pixels, clamped
 *     "grid":   { "rows":6, "cols":4, "gap":5, "pad":6 },

 *     ],
 *     "on": [
 *       { "click":"digit", "do":[ {"set":"display","to":"cat(display,key)"} ] }
 *     ]
 *   }
 *
 *   widgets[]  kind is button | label | field | panel. Placement is either grid
 *              (row/col/rowspan/colspan, exact-tiling via gui_grid) or an
 *              explicit "rect":[x,y,w,h] in client pixels. `name` is a unique
 *              handle; `tag` groups widgets so one handler serves ten digits.
 *              Optional flags: readonly, disabled, border, align.
 *              Optional colours: "fg":"#RRGGBB", "bg":"#RRGGBB" — CSS hex, six
 *              digits. These set the initial foreground and background colour of
 *              the widget, overriding the theme default. A handler may change
 *              them at runtime with {"set":"name.fg","to":"'#RRGGBB'"} or
 *              {"set":"name.bg","to":"'#RRGGBB'"}. An invalid colour string is
 *              silently ignored at runtime (the widget keeps its current colour)
 *              and rejected with an error at compile time.
 *
 *              TWO RULES THE RUNTIME APPLIES ON THE APP'S BEHALF, both because
 *              the alternative is an app that looks right and misbehaves:
 *                - a READONLY field is also made unclickable. A readout is
 *                  scenery, and gui_click resolves a widget by its visible text:
 *                  the moment a display reads "7", a click on "7" would be
 *                  ambiguous with the "7" key.
 *                - a widget any handler is BOUND TO is made clickable, even if
 *                  it is a label, a panel or a readonly field. Hanging a handler
 *                  on scenery would otherwise produce an app that never
 *                  responds, which is the hardest failure to diagnose from a
 *                  document that reads correctly. An explicit handler wins.
 *   vars       named cells, initialised from a JSON number or string. A var and
 *              a widget may not share a name — that would make an expression
 *              ambiguous, so it is refused rather than resolved by a rule nobody
 *              would remember.
 *   on[]       handlers. Exactly one event key per object:
 *                "click"  / "submit" — value is a widget name, a tag, or an
 *                                      array of either.
 *                "tick"             — value is a PERIOD IN MILLISECONDS
 *                                      (APP_TICK_MIN_MS..APP_TICK_MAX_MS). The
 *                                      handler runs that often for as long as the
 *                                      window is open, with `key` empty. This is
 *                                      what a clock, a stopwatch or a countdown
 *                                      is made of. At most APP_MAX_TICKS per app.
 *   statements {"set":<var|widget>,"to":"<expr>"} | {"if":"<expr>","then":[...],

 *                      ask the kernel to do something the app cannot do itself.
 *                      Every "with" value is an expression string; "into" is
 *                      optional and receives the outcome. At most APP_MAX_CALLS
 *                      call statements per document. See DECISION 4 for the
 *                      capabilities, their bounds, and why this is the security
 *                      boundary.
 *   expressions infix, evaluated left to right with C-like precedence, no side
 *              effects on anything but this app. Operands: numbers (fixed point,
 *              six decimals), 'single-quoted' strings, var names, widget names
 *              (their current text), `key` — the text of the widget that fired
 *              the handler — and the time snapshot:
 *                now      monotonic seconds since boot, millisecond resolution
 *                clock    "HH:MM:SS" (UTC)     today   "YYYY-MM-DD"
 *                hour minute second            numbers, 0-23 / 0-59 / 0-59
 *              Every wall-clock name is ERR on a machine whose clock cannot be
 *              read; `now` always works.
 *              Operators: + - * / % == != < <= > >= && || ! and unary -.
 *              Functions: num text cat len digits has iserr abs min max
 *                round(x)   nearest integer, halves away from zero
 *                rand(n)    a fresh whole number in 0..n-1, n in 1..APP_RAND_MAX

 *                           counting from 0; ERR when i is outside s
 *
 *   NUMBERS ARE FIXED POINT: int64 scaled by 1,000,000, so six decimal places
 *   and a magnitude limit of APP_NUM_MAX (9e9). No FPU is used or needed (this
 *   kernel is built -mno-sse); multiply and divide go through __int128 so an
 *   intermediate cannot wrap, and anything outside the range is ERR, never a
 *   wrapped number.

 *
 * DEPENDENCIES
 *   json.h to read the document, gui.h/widgets.h to instantiate it, and — only in
 *   apps/cap.c, only from app_service(), never from a handler — audio.h for the
 *   one capability that exists and trace.h to print the ground truth for it. The
 *   runtime proper still prints nothing, so it cannot interleave with the console
 *   mid-paint. No heap: instances live in a static pool, for the same reason
 *   gui.h's window pool does — an app that cannot start when memory is tight is an
 *   app that vanishes exactly when the operator needs to be told why. The only
 *   hardware is behind two replaceable function pointers — the wall clock and the
 *   entropy source — plus the capability broker, so the whole runtime, including
 *   the calculator, the clock and a beep into a synthetic sink, still runs on the
 *   host with no device model (tests/host/test_app.c, test_app_format.c,
 *   test_app_audio.c).
 *
 * FUTURE EXTENSION POINTS
 *   - Persisting an app is one VFS write: the document is the app, so "save that
 *     calculator" is fs_write of the bytes the model already sent.
 *   - MORE CAPABILITIES, which is what the shape in DECISION 4 was designed for: a
 *     row in apps/cap.c's table and a case in perform(), with no format change and
 *     no new syntax, because every argument is already an expression string. The
 *     three families worth having next, and the one bound each needs:
 *       fs.write / fs.read   a path allowlist (an app must not reach /etc), a byte
 *                            cap, and the same one-in-flight rule, since the VFS is
 *                            RAM-backed and a write is not instant.
 *       clock.alarm          nothing new: it is a tick handler plus a capability,
 *                            and the bound is APP_MAX_TICKS, which already exists.
 *       net.get              the only one that genuinely cannot be brokered as it
 *                            stands, because a TLS round trip is seconds long on a
 *                            polled kernel. It needs the asynchronous form below
 *                            first, or the machine stops answering while an app
 *                            fetches a web page.
 *   - AN ASYNCHRONOUS CAPABILITY. Everything above assumes a call is short enough
 *     to perform between two input polls, and audio.h's synchronous play contract
 *     is why an app's tone is capped at 200 ms. The honest fix is not a bigger
 *     constant here: it is a start/poll split in the service being brokered (for
 *     audio, "where is the device reading now?", which audio.h already lists as
 *     its own extension point), and then a third request state in apps/cap.c —
 *     started, and drained again on a later pass. The queue, the rate limit, the
 *     trace line and the "into" delivery are all already in the right place for
 *     that; only the perform() step would change.
 *   - Widget kinds are gui.h's business: when a list or a slider appears there,
 *     it becomes a `kind` string here and nothing else changes. The two shapes
 *     the enumeration above still cannot express both want one: a widget whose
 *     COLOUR an app can assign (colour picker, progress bar, traffic light) and a
 *     LIST (a todo list you can delete from). Neither is a language question:
 *     widgets.h already gives every widget an fg/bg, so the colour one is a
 *     `"color"` key plus letting `set` reach it.
 *   - The expression language has room for user functions (a name -> statement
 *     list map) without touching the evaluator, since the compiler already
 *     resolves names to indices at load time.

/* Longest sound one {"call":"audio.tone"} may ask for, in milliseconds, and the

 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING EITHER NUMBER. audio.h's play contract is synchronous
 * — a driver's play() must not return until the device has finished reading the
 * buffer, because the kernel refills it for the next sound — so the time a sound
 * takes is time the single-threaded polled loop is not answering the prompt.
 *
 * APP_CAP_AUDIO_MS_MAX BOUNDS THE DURATION AN APP MAY ASK FOR. IT DOES NOT BOUND
 * HOW LONG THE MACHINE BLOCKS. This header used to say the two constants bounded
 * the stall to "200 ms in any 500 ms, i.e. at most 40% of the machine", and that
 * was measurably false in the configuration this project exists to produce. When
 * the audio sink is a driver program the model wrote, core/audio.c's run_vm()
 * raises that program's cumulative delay budget to the sound's length PLUS
 * AUDIO_PLAY_MARGIN_US (250 ms), and the program spends it polling the device
 * with mdelay(), which yields to nothing. A 200 ms app tone was measured holding
 * the machine for 450 ms, and because the old interval was timed from the moment
 * a sound STARTED, that 450 ms came out of the 500 ms gap: 90% of the machine,
 * not 40%.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY BOUNDS IT NOW is measurement, in apps/cap.c: the pump reads the
 * clock either side of every call, and refuses the next one until the machine has
 * been free for at least as long as the last call blocked, PLUS APP_CAP_GAP_MS,
 * counted from the moment it finished. So the worst-case duty cycle is
 * block/(2*block + 500) — strictly under half however slow a driver is, and under
 * 4% for the 20-150 ms beeps a document actually asks for. A slow driver buys
 * itself a longer silence rather than a bigger share of the machine.
 *
 * APP_CAP_AUDIO_MS_MAX is still worth having, and is still far below audio.h's
 * own AUDIO_MAX_MS (1000), because it bounds the size of a single slice: a UI beep
 * is 60-150 ms, and a sound long enough to be music is the model's own audio_tone
 * tool, which is a traced tool call and not on this path.
 *
 * APP_CAP_QUIET_MAX_MS is the ceiling on a measured interval. A clock that jumps,
 * or a driver that spins its whole budget, must not be able to mute every app for
 * the rest of the boot; 4 s is well past any legitimate play and short enough that
 * a document recovers on its own. */
