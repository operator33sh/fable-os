/* gui.h — the window manager: windows, z-order, focus, damage, and the one
 *         event loop this machine has.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   The operator says "I want a calculator" and a calculator has to appear, be
 *   clickable, and not take the machine away from the sentence that asked for it.
 *   This header is the contract for that: a bounded pool of windows composited
 *   over the text console, a widget toolkit (widgets.h) to fill them with, and a
 *   cooperative tick that shares one single-threaded, interrupt-free CPU between
 *   the pointer, the keyboard, the windows and the natural-language turn loop.
 *
 *   Everything here is state and policy. All arithmetic on rectangles and all
 *   pixels are in widgets.h and lib/fb.c, which is why the whole of this module
 *   runs on the host against a malloc'd surface (tests/host/test_gui.c).
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION 1 — HOW THE CONSOLE AND THE WINDOWS SHARE THE DISPLAY
 * ============================================================================
 *   The operator talks to this machine in prose while apps are on screen, so the
 *   console cannot be replaced, hidden, or reduced to a window. It is the only
 *   place trace lines — the kernel's ground truth (trace.h) — can appear, and it
 *   is the only place the model's replies appear. Whatever else happens, `> `
 *   must stay visible and typeable.
 *
 *   Four designs were on the table:
 *
 *     (a) SPLIT THE SCREEN: console in rows [0,N), windows below. Requires
 *         teaching lib/base.c a smaller grid, i.e. changing the console's scroll
 *         and geometry — the one piece of code every subsystem prints through —
 *         and the console's geometry is what tools/screen_tools.c reads. Wrong
 *         blast radius, and it permanently spends half the screen on whichever
 *         half is idle.
 *
 *     (b) THE CONSOLE BECOMES A WINDOW. The most "correct" answer and the most
 *         dangerous one: the console would then depend on the WM being alive to
 *         be seen at all. A panic, a fault before gui_init(), or a bug in this
 *         file would leave a machine that cannot say what went wrong, on a
 *         machine whose only interface is words. The console must work when the
 *         GUI does not.
 *
 *     (c) WINDOWS ONLY WHILE THE CONSOLE IS IDLE (alternate full screens). No
 *         coexistence at all, and the demo requires coexistence.
 *
 *     (d) THE CONSOLE IS THE DESKTOP. Chosen. Windows float above the text, and
 *         the WM composites: for any damaged region it repaints the console's
 *         own cells first (it can, from console_fb() — the grid is public and the
 *         font is shared), then every window that intersects, bottom to top, then
 *         the pointer. The console keeps drawing exactly as it always has and
 *         does not know the GUI exists; the GUI needs no cooperation from
 *         lib/base.c and no change to it.
 *
 *   WHY (d) IS SAFE, in terms of what lib/base.c actually does. Its renderer
 *   keeps a shadow of the cell grid and redraws a cell only when the cell's
 *   VALUE changes. A window's pixels sit on top of cells whose values nobody
 *   touched, so printing a line of prose does not erase a window — it repaints
 *   only the cells it wrote and its own cursor cell. Three things do disturb a
 *   window, and each has an answer:
 *
 *     - text printed under the window: the cell value changed, so the console
 *       draws a glyph over the window. gui_tick() sees the changed cell in its
 *       own copy of the grid, damages it, and the compositor puts the window
 *       back on the next tick.
 *     - the console cursor block, which is redrawn every kputc: same mechanism,
 *       and it is one 8x16 cell.
 *     - a SCROLL, which shifts every pixel up one text row and presents the
 *       whole screen. Cell values change wherever there was text, but a window's
 *       pixels MOVE without any cell it covers changing, so cell-diffing cannot
 *       see it: the window is left with a copy of its own top rows smeared above
 *       it. So gui_tick() ASKS how far the screen moved rather than inferring it:
 *       lib/base.c counts its own scrolls (console_scrolls()), scroll() is the only
 *       thing in the kernel that shifts console pixels, and the difference between
 *       two readings is therefore exact. Each window is damaged together with the
 *       band above it; a gap deeper than the screen repaints once.
 *
 *       This used to be inferred by matching the grid against a shifted shadow,
 *       gated on "the console's cursor is on its last row" as a proxy for "a scroll
 *       put it there". The proxy is FALSE: the prompt lives on the last row for the
 *       entire life of the machine, so the gate was open forever, and a shadow
 *       match of 0 (which meant both "did not scroll" and "scrolled deeper than the
 *       probe looks") fell back to repainting all 786,432 pixels. Every keystroke
 *       at the prompt cost a full-screen composite: 31.7 ms per character with two
 *       windows open, against 0.08 ms with none. Asking is both exact and cheap,
 *       and it also sees a scroll of blank lines, which no amount of cell-diffing
 *       can.
 *
 *   THE HONEST COST, stated rather than hidden: between the console drawing a
 *   glyph and the next gui_tick() there is a window with a character on it. The
 *   tick runs on every iteration of the idle loop, so the gap is microseconds
 *   while the machine is waiting for input — but it is a real gap, and during a
 *   model round-trip (see DECISION 3) it is as long as the round-trip. This is
 *   the price of not owning the console, and it is the right price.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION 2 — DAMAGE, NOT FRAMES
 * ============================================================================
 *   There is no vblank, no timer interrupt and no compositor thread. A full
 *   1024x768 repaint means ~800k pixel writes plus 6144 glyph rasterisations
 *   plus a 3 MiB present, at -O0, on the same CPU that has to answer the
 *   keyboard: unusable as a per-frame cost. So nothing is ever repainted
 *   because time passed — only because a specific rectangle became wrong.
 *
 *   Every state change names the rectangle it invalidated: opening a window
 *   damages its frame; moving one damages the union of where it was and where it
 *   is; pressing a button damages the button; the pointer damages the two cursor
 *   rectangles it left and entered; a console write damages the cells it wrote.
 *   gui_flush() paints the accumulated list and presents each rectangle
 *   separately, so a keypress on a calculator costs about 40x20 pixels.
 *
 *   The list is fixed at GUI_MAX_DAMAGE entries and never allocates. Adding a
 *   rectangle merges it into an existing one when the merged area is not much
 *   larger than the two separately (cheaper to repaint one region than to walk
 *   the window list twice); when the list is full, everything collapses into its
 *   bounding box. Over-damaging is always safe and never wrong — the invariant
 *   is only that damage is a SUPERSET of what changed, which is what makes it
 *   testable: tests/host/test_gui.c asserts pixels outside the damage did not
 *   move and pixels inside are correct.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION 3 — THE EVENT LOOP ON A MACHINE WITH NO SCHEDULER
 * ============================================================================
 *   IF is 0, all 16 PIC lines are masked, there is one thread, and nothing runs
 *   unless something calls it. There is therefore no such thing here as "the GUI
 *   event loop": there is ONE loop, in kernel/main.c, and the GUI is a function
 *   it calls.
 *
 *       for (;;) {
 *           gui_tick();                     <- pointer, widgets, repaint
 *           n = input_poll(line, sizeof line);   <- keyboard/serial, one line
 *           if (n == INPUT_NONE) continue;
 *           if (gui_take_line(line, n)) continue;   <- typed into a field
 *           chat_ask(line);                 <- the model acts on the machine
 *       }
 *
 *   Four properties make that fair, and each one is a deliberate choice:
 *
 *     1. gui_tick() IS BOUNDED AND NEVER BLOCKS. It drains at most
 *        GUI_EVENT_BUDGET mouse events, diffs the console grid once, paints the
 *        damage list, and returns. No waiting, no retry loop, no "until quiet".
 *        Its worst case is one full-screen composite; its normal case, with
 *        nothing moving, is a grid diff and an immediate return.
 *
 *     2. IT DOES NOTHING AT ALL WITH NO WINDOWS OPEN. Not a repaint, not a mouse
 *        poll, not a grid diff. A normal boot is therefore byte-for-byte and
 *        pixel-for-pixel what it was before this module existed, and the PS/2
 *        mouse stream stays muted (see DECISION 4). The GUI costs nothing until
 *        somebody asks for a window.
 *
 *     3. THE KEYBOARD BELONGS TO THE PROMPT, and the GUI can borrow it for
 *        exactly one line. This machine's only interface is language; a widget
 *        that captures the keyboard is a widget that can strand the operator with
 *        no shell to escape to. So clicking an editable field ARMS a one-line
 *        grab: the next completed line goes into the field, the grab is released,
 *        and the line after it goes to the model. gui_wants_keys() reports the
 *        armed state and gui_take_line() consumes it. There is no key sequence to
 *        learn and no state to get stuck in.
 *
 *     4. THE POINTER BELONGS TO THE GUI, always. Mouse motion never reaches the
 *        turn loop and typing never moves the cursor, so the two interfaces
 *        cannot fight over an event. Both drivers check the i8042 AUX bit, so they
 *        cannot steal each other's bytes either — see DECISION 4.
 *
 *   WHAT IS NOT FAIR, AND EXACTLY HOW MUCH. chat_ask() blocks for as long as the
 *   model takes (net/net.c spins on net_service() until a deadline), and this
 *   module cannot get a tick in edgeways from outside. During a turn the GUI is
 *   frozen: no repaint, and mouse bytes are lost because the i8042 output buffer
 *   holds one byte. Nothing is corrupted — the decoder resynchronises on the
 *   always-one bit and the partial-packet timeout (mouse.h) — but a click during
 *   a turn does not happen. The fix is one line in a file this module does not
 *   own: net/net.c's net_service() should call gui_tick(), which is bounded,
 *   re-entrant-safe with respect to the console, and a no-op with no windows.
 *   Until then, gui_tick() is called from every loop that DOES belong to the GUI,
 *   and the freeze is bounded by the transport's own deadline.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION 4 — THE POINTER IS OFF UNTIL A WINDOW EXISTS
 * ============================================================================
 *   The keyboard and the mouse share ONE one-byte i8042 output buffer and are told
 *   apart only by AUX status bit 5. Whoever polls first gets the byte and there is
 *   no way to put it back, so both drivers have to check that bit. mouse.h always
 *   did; drivers/input/kbd.c did not, and the consequence was not cosmetic: a
 *   mouse packet's first byte is 0x08|buttons|signs (0x08 = '7', 0x18 = 'o' in the
 *   scancode table) and a delta of 0x1C is Enter, so with any window open, moving
 *   the mouse typed garbage at the natural-language prompt and SUBMITTED it to the
 *   model — while the pointer itself received nothing, because the keyboard had
 *   eaten the stream. Confirmed on real QEMU: dozens of unintended model turns
 *   from mouse motion alone, and it persisted for the rest of the boot even after
 *   every window was closed.
 *
 *   THAT IS NOW FIXED at the source: kbd_getchar_nb() tests the AUX bit and hands
 *   the byte to mouse_accept_byte() rather than decoding it, so the mouse keeps its
 *   framing even when the keyboard wins the race. Two bounds remain by design:
 *
 *     - the hardware stream still starts MUTED and is armed only by the first
 *       consumer poll, so a machine that never opens a window is byte-for-byte the
 *       machine that existed before the GUI;
 *     - hiding the pointer (including automatically, when the last window closes)
 *       now calls mouse_stop(), so a device nobody is listening to is quiet
 *       instead of merely harmless.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT AN APP IS
 * ============================================================================
 *   A window id, some widgets, and one hook:
 *
 *       uint32_t id = gui_window_open("Calculator", 40, 60, 240, 300, 0);
 *       gui_window_t *w = gui_window(id);
 *       gui_rect_t area = gui_inset(gui_client_area(w), 6, 6);
 *       gui_rect_t keys, disp = gui_split_top(area, 28, 6, &keys);
 *       gui_add_field(w, disp, "0", CALC_DISPLAY, GUI_W_READONLY);
 *       for (...) gui_add_button(w, gui_grid(keys, 5, 4, r, c, 1, 1, 4), "7", ...);
 *       gui_set_hook(id, calc_event);
 *
 *   The hook is called with the widget that fired and a gui_event_t; it mutates
 *   widget text and calls gui_invalidate_widget(). It never draws and never
 *   presents. gui/gui_demo.c is exactly that, in 200 lines, and is the worked
 *   example the app-authoring phase generalises: everything the model will need
 *   to emit is a call in this header.

 *   stats       gui_stats
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES
 *   widgets.h (and through it fb.h + font.h) for everything drawn; mouse.h for
 *   the event shape; kernel.h for the console grid and kprintf. No heap: the
 *   window pool is static, because a GUI that cannot open a window when memory
 *   is tight is a GUI that vanishes exactly when the operator needs to be told
 *   why. No hardware: gui_attach() takes the surface and the console grid as
 *   arguments, which is how the host tests drive the whole module.
 *
 * FUTURE EXTENSION POINTS
 *   - Per-window backing stores: gui_paint_window() already draws through a
 *     clipped fb_surface_t, so pointing it at a window-sized surface and
 *     fb_blit()ing the result is a change in one function.
 *   - Resize handles, minimise, and a task bar are policy on top of the same
 *     damage and hit-test primitives; gui_window_resize() already exists and
 *     re-lays nothing (widgets are in client coordinates and the app owns them).
 *   - A window that shows console text (a scrollback viewer) needs no new
 *     mechanism: the compositor already renders console cells.
 *   - Once an IDT services devices, mouse events arrive from an ISR calling
 *     mouse_feed_byte(); gui_tick() keeps draining the same queue.
