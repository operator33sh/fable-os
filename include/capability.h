/* capability.h — the machine keeps and reuses what it builds.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   Everything else in this kernel is a verb the model may use once. The driver
 *   VM lets it author a program, run it, and watch it work — and then the program
 *   is gone, because dvm_run() keeps no state between calls and the assembled
 *   image lives in one caller's buffer. The next turn starts from nothing.
 *
 *   That is the difference between a machine that can do things when asked and a
 *   machine that grows. A capability is the second thing: a program the model
 *   wrote, given a NAME, a documented SIGNATURE and a home on DISK, so that it
 *   can be called later — by the model, by another capability, and (see FUTURE
 *   EXTENSION POINTS) by an app — without being written again. `driver_install`
 *   already proved the shape for exactly one case, audio sinks. This is that
 *   shape with the device-specific part taken out.
 *
 *   The audio path is worth stating precisely, because it is the thing being
 *   generalised: the model wrote an AC'97 bring-up, driver_install kept the
 *   assembled image, and a later turn played a note with no program written.
 *   The parts of that which were audio-specific were the registry it landed in
 *   and the signature it had to match. Take both out and what is left is: keep
 *   the source, keep a signature, keep a name, and let anything call it.
 *
 * WHAT A CAPABILITY IS
 *   A record on disk with four parts:
 *
 *     name       an identifier, [a-z][a-z0-9_]*, unique on the machine.
 *     doc        one line of prose. This is what the model reads to decide
 *                whether to call it, so it is part of the contract, not a
 *                comment.
 *     params     an ordered list of parameter NAMES. Every parameter is an
 *                unsigned 64-bit number: the arity is the signature.
 *     body       either a driver-VM program (source text, kept verbatim) or a
 *                COMPOSITION — an ordered list of calls to other capabilities.
 *
 *   Nothing else. In particular a capability carries no policy of its own: the
 *   sandbox it runs in is built here, in C, identically for every capability, so
 *   a saved record can never widen its own reach. What that sandbox is, and the
 *   holes in it, are enumerated under THE SANDBOX below.
 *
 * THE CALLING CONVENTION — one ABI, for every capability, forever
 *   A capability is a function from up to CAP_MAX_PARAMS numbers to one number
 *   plus an optional string. A per-capability return declaration was considered
 *   and rejected: it is one more thing for a model to get wrong, and the schema
 *   bytes are better spent on the doc line.
 *
 *     ON ENTRY   r0..r(nparam-1) hold the declared parameters, in order.
 *                Every other register is zero. The scratch arena is zeroed by
 *                dvm_run() itself, so a capability never sees another's bytes.
 *
 *     ON HALT    r0                      the result. One number.
 *                r1, r2                  offset and LENGTH of an optional text
 *                                        result in the scratch arena. r2 == 0
 *                                        means "no text". Forced to printable
 *                                        ASCII and clipped to CAP_TEXT_MAX by
 *                                        this module before anyone sees it.
 *                r3 == CAP_TAILCALL      request a TAIL CALL (see COMPOSITION).
 *                r4, r5                  offset and length of the callee's NAME,
 *                                        as bytes in the scratch arena.
 *                r6..r11                 the callee's arguments.
 *
 *   The name of a tail-call target is built by the program at run time with the
 *   string ops (`mstr`), which is why dispatch is dynamic rather than baked in.
 *
 * COMPOSITION — and the hard constraint that shapes all of it
 *   dvm_run() REFUSES TO BE RE-ENTERED (DVM_TRAP_REENTRY, and dvm.h argues the
 *   case at length: there is one scratch arena, it is zeroed on entry, and one
 *   pair of DMA guard bands). So there is no way — none — for a capability to
 *   call another one from the middle of its own execution. A `cap.call` syscall
 *   would trap on the first use. That is a contract this module does not own and
 *   should not route around, so composition here happens BETWEEN runs, in C:
 *
 *     TAIL CALLS (a program capability). The program finishes, and its last act
 *     is to name a successor and hand it arguments. Nothing of the caller needs
 *     preserving, so this is a LOOP in the dispatcher, not recursion: a chain of
 *     ten thousand tail calls costs no kernel stack at all. Accumulator-passing
 *     is therefore the natural way to write iteration and recursion here —
 *     factorial is `fact(n, acc)` tail-calling `fact(n-1, acc*n)` — and
 *     tests/host/test_capability.c runs exactly that.
 *
 *     COMPOSITIONS (a compose capability). An ordered list of steps, each one a
 *     call to another capability whose arguments are wired from this
 *     capability's own parameters, from an earlier step's result, or from a
 *     literal. A step may carry a guard, so a composition can stop calling
 *     itself. Steps run in order, each to completion, and the composition's
 *     result is the last executed step's result. This IS C recursion, one frame
 *     per nested composition, which is why it is depth-bounded.
 *
 *   WHAT COMPOSITION CANNOT DO, stated plainly: pass text. Arguments are
 *   numbers, because the arena is zeroed between runs and there is nothing this
 *   module could hand across that dvm_run() would not immediately erase. Two
 *   capabilities that need to exchange bytes do it through a file in the data
 *   root (fs.write / fs.read), which is durable, inspectable and already bounded.
 *   The text result of a composition is the text of its last executed step, for
 *   the same reason.
 *
 * WHY A CYCLE CANNOT HANG THE MACHINE
 *   A capability may name itself, and two capabilities may name each other. No
 *   attempt is made to detect that statically — a cycle is often the point, and a
 *   static check would have to be conservative about a guard whose value is only
 *   known at run time. Instead every cycle is TERMINATED by counters that only
 *   ever decrease within one top-level call, and there are four of them because
 *   a cycle can be paid for in four different currencies:
 *
 *     CAP_MAX_DEPTH        nested composition frames. This is the bound on
 *                          KERNEL STACK, and it is the reason tail calls are
 *                          deliberately not counted here — they consume none.
 *     CAP_MAX_INVOCATIONS  capability invocations of any kind in one top-level
 *                          call, tail calls included. This is the counter an
 *                          unguarded tail-call loop hits, and the one that makes
 *                          "the chain is finite" true rather than hoped for.
 *     CAP_TREE_STEPS       driver-VM instructions summed over the WHOLE tree.
 *                          Per-run budgets alone bound nothing: 64 runs of
 *                          100,000 steps is 6.4M steps of work nobody asked for.
 *     CAP_TREE_DELAY_US    microseconds spent in `delay` summed over the tree,
 *                          for exactly the same reason. This is the one that
 *                          bounds WALL CLOCK, which is what "hang" means to an
 *                          operator waiting at a prompt.
 *
 *   Each counter is charged before the work happens and never reset inside a
 *   call, so the tree is finite by construction. Exceeding any of them is
 *   CAP_EDEPTH or CAP_EBUDGET with the call CHAIN in the message
 *   ("countdown -> countdown -> countdown ..."), because "recursion limit" with
 *   no path is not something a model can fix.
 *
 * THE SANDBOX — what a capability may touch, and the holes, enumerated
 *   A capability gets NO DEVICE ACCESS AT ALL: no port I/O, no MMIO, no PCI, no
 *   DMA grant, and no bus-master bit. That is not a weakened driver sandbox, it
 *   is the absence of one. Hardware bring-up already has a home (driver_run and
 *   driver_install, which name a target and derive a window from its BARs);
 *   mixing the two would mean every saved capability carried a device grant it
 *   almost never needs. The dividend is that this whole module — dispatcher,
 *   budgets, ABI, composition — is testable on a host with no hardware at all.
 *
 *   What is left open, one line of justification each:
 *     con.write   the capability's own voice. It goes out through trace.c, so a
 *                 program still cannot put a '[' in column zero.
 *     fs.read     a capability that can keep what it computed is the entire
 *     fs.write    point of this file. CONFINED TO THE DATA ROOT, which is NOT
 *     fs.size     the capability store: a capability cannot rewrite the
 *                 machine's capabilities, and that confinement is enforced by
 *                 vm/dvm.c's portable half, so a host test proves it.
 *     time.ms     a timeout that is a real timeout rather than a loop count.
 *
 *   NOT granted: audio.tone, because the machine's audio sink may itself be a
 *   driver program and servicing that syscall would re-enter dvm_run(); and
 *   anything that reaches the network, because there is no such syscall.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE, VERSIONS, AND WHAT ROLLBACK ACTUALLY MEANS
 *   One file per capability under the store root, plus at most one backup:
 *
 *     <store>/<name>.cap     the current version
 *     <store>/<name>.bak     the version before it, if there was one
 *
 *   The store is FS_DISK_MOUNT "/cap" when a disk is mounted and "/cap" on
 *   ramfs otherwise — capability_store_persists() says which, and it is said out
 *   loud at boot and in every tool result, because a capability that will not
 *   survive the night is a different promise from one that will.
 *
 *   THE FILE FORMAT is 16 lowercase hex digits, a newline, and then a JSON
 *   object. The hex is an FNV-1a-64 hash of every byte after the newline, and it
 *   is checked before the JSON is parsed, before the source is assembled, and
 *   before anything is registered. Deliberately NOT a bespoke text format with a
 *   bespoke parser: json.h is hardened and fuzzed and this file writes no
 *   parsing of its own (the 17-byte prefix is a fixed layout, not a grammar).
 *   A record whose hash does not match, whose JSON is malformed, whose name
 *   disagrees with its filename, or whose program no longer assembles is
 *   REJECTED — it never enters the registry — and then <name>.bak is tried.
 *   That is what makes a half-written file at power-off a recoverable event.
 *
 *   SAVE ORDER IS THE CONSISTENCY GUARANTEE, and it is the one thing here that
 *   has to be got right: the backup is written and flushed FIRST, then the
 *   current file is overwritten. So an interrupted save leaves either the old
 *   version intact (the overwrite never started) or a corrupt current file with
 *   a good backup beside it (which the next boot detects and falls back to). The
 *   working version is never the thing at risk.
 *
 *   VERSIONS ARE MONOTONIC PER NAME and never reused. capability_revert() does
 *   not decrement anything: it reads the backup and SAVES it again under the
 *   next version number, so "roll back v4" produces v5 whose contents are v3's,
 *   the broken v4 becomes the new backup, and reverting twice is a redo. There
 *   is exactly ONE level of undo. A model that saves twice over a working
 *   capability has lost it, and the tool says so before it does it.
 *
 *   REPLACEMENT CANNOT BREAK A CALLER MID-FLIGHT, for a structural reason
 *   rather than a locking one: this machine is single-threaded and polled, a
 *   tool call runs to completion before the next one starts, and a capability
 *   program cannot reach the store (see THE SANDBOX). So there is no instant at
 *   which a save and a call overlap. Within one call the source of each
 *   capability is read once and pinned for the duration of the chain.
 *
 * DISCOVERABILITY — the failure this is built to avoid
 *   A capability the model cannot find is the same as no capability. It has
 *   happened on this machine: the model apologised for lacking something it was
 *   holding. The system prompt (net/chat.c) tells the model in as many words
 *   that the tool list "is the kernel's tool registry, assembled from it
 *   mechanically - it is not a summary, so if a capability is not in it, this
 *   machine genuinely does not have it". So the list of saved capabilities lives
 *   IN THE TOOL SCHEMA, inside capability_call's description, where the model
 *   reads it without having to ask: capability_panel().
 *
 *   THAT PANEL IS A FIXED NUMBER OF BYTES — exactly CAP_PANEL_CHARS characters,
 *   space-padded, no newlines, no '"' and no '\'. Not for tidiness: the
 *   assembled schema size is a compile-time constant in this tree
 *   (CHAT_REGISTRY_BYTES in include/chat.h, which `make test-qemu` fails on if
 *   the boot banner disagrees), and a description that grew with the contents of
 *   a DISK would make that constant a function of what the operator saved last
 *   night. Padding to a fixed width keeps the schema size independent of the
 *   store, and capability_panel_check() asserts the rendered length equals the
 *   reserved length and prints BOTH numbers if it ever does not.
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES
 *   dvm.h (the machine), vfs.h (the store), json.h (the record), trace.h (the
 *   ground-truth line), and the libc shim's snprintf. No heap: the registry, the
 *   one program image and the one file buffer are static, because a capability
 *   that cannot be loaded when memory is tight is a capability the machine
 *   cannot rely on. No hardware: dvm_io_t is passed with every device hook NULL
 *   and only the syscall backend set, which is why tests/host/test_capability.c
 *   drives the real dispatcher with a synthetic kernel.
 *
 * SIZE NOTE
 *   The registry, the shared program image, the source buffer and the file
 *   buffer are static and always present: see the CAP_* limits below for the
 *   arithmetic. Nothing here is allocated per call.
 *
 * FUTURE EXTENSION POINTS
 *   - AN APP CALLING A CAPABILITY is one table entry away and is deliberately
 *     not done here: apps/cap.c is the single brokered path from a document to
 *     the kernel, it validates every argument against a fixed table, and it
 *     performs the call from the idle loop rather than from inside a handler.
 *     A capability call fits that shape exactly — name plus up to
 *     CAP_MAX_PARAMS bounded numbers, queued and performed by C — and wants one
 *     new entry in that file's capability table calling capability_invoke(),
 *     with the rate limit that is already there. Reported, not written: apps/ is
 *     not this module's to edit.
 *   - TEXT ARGUMENTS: capability_invoke_text() now provides a thin wrapper that
 *     writes each string to <data_root>/_cap_arg{n} before calling through to
 *     capability_invoke(), so programs can read them with fs.read. The slot
 *     indices (0, 1, …) are passed as the numeric args. A per-run scratch
 *     WINDOW in vm/dvm.c would be a cleaner future shape, but the file route
 *     is observable, debuggable, and requires no VM changes.
 *   - A capability that wants a device is really a driver; the seam is
 *     driver_install's. If the two ever merge, the merge point is the sandbox
 *     builder in core/capability.c and nothing above it.
 *   - Static cycle detection would let a runaway composition be refused at SAVE
 *     time rather than at call time. It needs the guard evaluated symbolically,
 *     so it is a real piece of work, and the run-time counters make it an
 *     improvement in the error message rather than in safety.
 *   - Capabilities are global. Once there are users or processes, the owner
 *     field belongs next to `version`, and the store gains a subdirectory.
