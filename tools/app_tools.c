/* app_tools.c — the model builds an application and runs it.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   "hey I want a calculator" ends here. gui_open (tools/gui_tools.c) can start
 *   an app that a human compiled into the kernel; this tool lets the model AUTHOR
 *   one — write a document, launch it, look at what it did, fix it, launch it
 *   again — with no C, no compiler and no reboot.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ONE TOOL, WITH AN `action` — AND THE REASON IS A SHARED BUDGET, NOT TASTE
 * ============================================================================
 *   The assembled tool schema is a shared resource. chat.h sets
 *   CHAT_TOOLS_BYTES and net/chat.c's tools_load() refuses the WHOLE array if it
 *   does not fit, which offers the model NO TOOLS AT ALL — a total failure, so
 *   the bound is respected rather than tested.
 *
 *   So launch / list / state / close / format are ONE tool with an `action`, the
 *   schema states no enum (the description lists the actions instead), x and y
 *   are accepted but documented in action=format's OUTPUT rather than in the
 *   schema, and the FULL format specification is tool output too, because a
 *   result costs nothing from the schema budget.
 *
 *   HISTORICAL NOTE, because the old number here was quoted for a while after it
 *   stopped being true: this comment used to say CHAT_TOOLS_BYTES was 32768 and
 *   that the file fitted "with FIVE BYTES to spare". CHAT_TOOLS_BYTES is 40960
 *   today. Measured on this tree the whole registry assembles to well under it
 *   with kilobytes free, so the description below could afford to spend a few
 *   hundred bytes buying discoverability. Do not re-derive that headroom from a
 *   comment — tests/host/test_app.c measures the REAL assembled array and prints
 *   both numbers.
 *
 * THE FEEDBACK LOOP IS THE PRODUCT
 *   A model gets a document wrong on the first try — a mistyped key, a widget
 *   name it never declared, an unbalanced bracket in an expression. What makes
 *   the second try work is being told exactly what was wrong, so every rejection
 *   reports the JSON path, the reason, the byte offset inside an expression, and
 *   the names or values that WOULD have been accepted. It also says plainly that
 *   nothing was launched, because a model that believes a half-built window
 *   exists will try to repair it instead of resending it.
 *
 * UNTRUSTED INPUT
 *   `call->input` is model output and is read only through json.h. The document
 *   is handed to app_launch() as a raw span (or decoded out of a JSON string into
 *   one fixed buffer), where it is validated in full before any window exists.
 *   Nothing here indexes memory with a number from the model: ids are looked up
 *   in the instance pool, and coordinates are range-checked here and clamped
 *   again by the WM.
 *
 * EVERY CALL EMITS EXACTLY ONE TRACE LINE
 *   Success and failure both, through trace.h, from real return values after the
 *   call happened — so the transcript shows the id that was really opened and the
 *   path that was really refused, not what the model said it did.

 * that finishes: the model would be missing exactly the part it did not know was
 * missing. tests/host/test_app.c asserts the length, so an edit here cannot
 * quietly lose the last paragraph. What did not fit is carried by the rejection
 * messages instead, which is where a model reads it anyway — a wrong widget key
 * is answered with the list of accepted keys, an unknown function with the list
 * of functions, and every bound with its number, so none of that has to be spent
 * here. */
/* WHAT A LIVE RUN CHANGED HERE. apps/ grew round(), rand(), at() and the time
 * leaves (now, clock, today, hour, minute, second) and NOTHING on the tool
 * surface said so, which means the model could not have used them: it does not
 * guess function names into a validator that rejects unknown ones. They are
 * named in the list below, and the two idioms worth a sentence (money rounding
 * and 0..n-1) are glossed there rather than in the description, which has to
 * stay readable.
 *
 * WHAT PAID FOR THEM, and the honest cost: "(+rowspan/colspan)" came out. This
 * text was 1005 of the 1023 usable bytes, so 60 bytes of new material had to
 * come from somewhere. Spans are the safest thing to lose, because they are the
 * one omission this file's own error path repairs for free: apps/runtime.c
 * validates widget keys against a list and names every accepted key when one is
 * unknown, so a model that reaches for a span is told it exists, whereas a
 * function name it never sees is a function it never calls. rect:[x,y,w,h] also
 * still covers any layout a span could express.
 *
 * "tick(ms 50+)" cost 16 bytes and was paid for by "round(x) nearest whole" ->
 * "round(x) whole" (8) and by the compact spelling of the event itself. The
 * text is measured, not estimated: tests/host/test_app.c prints its exact size
 * and fails the suite at CHAT_TOOL_RESULT_CAP, so an edit here that overflows
 * takes the last paragraph off the model's copy and is caught immediately.
 *
 * WHAT THE CAPABILITY STATEMENT COST, since this text is a zero-sum budget and
 * the next person to add a line needs to know where the bytes came from. Adding
 * {call,with,into} plus one clause naming what it is for spent about 70 bytes, and
 * the spec was already 1005 of the 1023 the model ever sees. Three things paid:
 *   - "round(x) whole; rand(n) 0..n-1; at(s,i) one char;" (48 bytes) came out. It
 *     was DUPLICATE: the always-sent description above says "rand(n) is 0..n-1,
 *     round(x*100)/100 is money, at(s,i) picks a character" in more words, and the
 *     three names are still in the function list here, so nothing became
 *     undiscoverable. This is the cheapest 48 bytes in the file for exactly that
 *     reason — prefer duplicated bytes over unique ones when trimming.
 *   - "title":"Counter" left the worked document (18 bytes). Also duplicated: the
 *     description's own example carries "title":"Hi", and the key is optional, so
 *     the document still launches — which a test proves by extracting and running
 *     it. It is the only key in that example that is not load-bearing.
 *   - four words of prose ("place by", "is", "gives"), which cost nothing.
 * The full capability specification is NOT here: it is action=caps, a second page,
 * because it needs ~800 bytes and no amount of trimming would have found those.
 * put_caps() explains that split. tests/host/test_app.c measures this text and
 * fails at CHAT_TOOL_RESULT_CAP, and the golden transcript in that suite pins two
 * literal fragments of it ("Launch this document, then adapt it" and "iserr()
 * finds it"), so an edit here is checked in three ways before it ships.
 *
 * "tick" IS NOW DOCUMENTED, and only because the pump exists. It was left out
 * on purpose for as long as nothing called app_tick(): a tick handler was
 * accepted, registered and never run, so advertising it would have made this
 * tool lie about a window that says 0.0 s forever. kernel/main.c's
 * wait_for_sentence() now calls app_tick() before gui_tick(), so the event is
 * real and the line below says so. If that call is ever removed, this word
 * comes out in the same commit - and note that removing it from here is not
 * enough on its own, because apps/runtime.c's own rejection messages enumerate
 * the accepted event keys, so a model that mistypes {"every":1000} is told
 * "tick" exists whatever this text says. */
