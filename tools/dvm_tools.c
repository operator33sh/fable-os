/* dvm_tools.c — the model writes a device driver, and this file runs it.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   Everything before this file built the pieces: pci_list finds hardware
 *   nobody drives (tools/dev_tools.c), the driver VM executes a bring-up
 *   sequence that cannot crash the kernel (include/dvm.h), and a hand-written
 *   AC'97 program proved the VM really does drive silicon (vm/programs/).
 *   This file is the loop that joins them:
 *
 *       pci_list unclaimed_only=true   "nobody drives 00:05.0"
 *       driver_targets                 "here is the exact sandbox 00:05.0 gets"
 *       driver_assemble                "does my program even parse?"      (free)
 *       driver_run                     "run it"        -> it failed, here is why
 *       driver_run                     "run the fixed one"  -> the device is up
 *
 *   The model writes the driver. The kernel decides what the driver may touch,
 *   runs it, and reports what actually happened — every value in that report
 *   was read back out of the device microseconds earlier.
 *
 * THE TOOLS
 *   driver_targets   which devices a program may be pointed at, and for each
 *                    one the port/MMIO/PCI windows it would be granted, or the
 *                    reason it is not targetable at all.
 *   driver_assemble  syntax-check a program and get a numbered listing back.
 *                    Touches no hardware, costs no attempt: this is where a
 *                    model should burn its typos.
 *   driver_run       assemble + execute against ONE NAMED DEVICE. TOOL_MUTATES:
 *                    it writes to real device registers.
 *   driver_install   keep a second, shorter program as the machine's AUDIO SINK,
 *                    re-run by core/audio.c for every sound. This is the step
 *                    that turns "the card is up" into "the machine can play".
 *   driver_trace     page through the access log of the last run, for when the
 *                    tail that fitted in driver_run's answer was not enough.
 *
 * THE SANDBOX IS DERIVED, NEVER SUPPLIED
 *   The model names a DEVICE ("pci00:05.0"), never an address. Everything the
 *   program is allowed to touch is computed here, from that function's own
 *   configuration space:
 *
 *     - each programmed BAR becomes one window: ports get [base, base+size),
 *       memory BARs get the same as an MMIO window with read+write;
 *     - `size` is not readable from a BAR (sizing needs config-space writes,
 *       which this kernel refuses), so it is bounded three ways and the
 *       smallest wins: the BAR's own natural alignment, a hard cap
 *       (256 bytes of I/O, which is the PCI maximum, or 1 MiB of MMIO), and
 *       the distance to the next BAR base found anywhere on the bus, so a
 *       window can never swallow a neighbouring device's registers;
 *     - the local APIC / IOAPIC / HPET block at 0xFEC00000-0xFEEFFFFF is
 *       seeded into that neighbour list as a barrier, and a BAR that lands
 *       inside it is refused outright;
 *     - exactly one PCI function is opened for `pcicfg`, and config-space
 *       WRITES do not exist in the ISA at all;
 *     - the VM's own DMA scratch buffer is granted, at an address this file gets
 *       from dvm.c and never computes;
 *     - the whole thing is then handed to dvm_policy_check(), so the VM's own
 *       compiled-in deny list (PICs, PIT, PS/2, CMOS, COM1, 0xCF8, all memory
 *       below the end of the kernel image) gets the last word. A device whose
 *       BAR overlaps any of it is reported as untargetable rather than
 *       silently trimmed.
 *
 * WHAT IS REFUSED BEFORE A SINGLE INSTRUCTION RUNS
 *   - a device that is not PCI-backed: there is no BAR to derive a window from,
 *     and the legacy ports those devices use are on the VM's deny list anyway;
 *   - a device with a driver bound: two drivers on one device is a race, and
 *     the resident driver would be the one to fall over;
 *   - a display controller: that is the operator's console (see target_blocked).
 *
 * DMA, AND THE PART THAT IS NOT CONTAINED
 *   A program that can only poke registers can reset a codec. It cannot play a
 *   sound, because a DMA engine has to be handed a physical address and the VM
 *   used to have no memory to name. Two things fixed that, and both of them are
 *   real privilege, so they are described here plainly rather than buried:
 *
 *     1. A DMA SCRATCH BUFFER. include/dvm.h owns one 256 KiB page-aligned static
 *        arena. build_sandbox() grants it and passes its physical address and size
 *        in r7/r8. This file never computes that address: it asks dvm.c, and
 *        dvm_policy_allow_dma() refuses anything that is not a subrange of dvm.c's
 *        own array, so a bug here cannot turn into a window on the heap.
 *
 *     2. BUS MASTER ENABLE, set by this file. `pcicfg` is a read-only opcode and
 *        stays that way — one bad config dword moves a live device's BAR — so
 *        t_driver_run() sets PCI command bit 2 (plus bit 0 and/or bit 1 if the
 *        sandbox granted I/O or memory windows, without which the program cannot
 *        reach its own BARs) on the ONE named function, reads the register back to
 *        see which bits actually stuck, and clears exactly the bits it added if the
 *        program did not reach halt. A program that halted keeps them, because it
 *        may have started a transfer the operator is meant to hear.
 *
 *   WHAT THAT DOES NOT BUY. The VM bounds what the PROGRAM touches. Nothing here
 *   bounds what the HARDWARE does once the program has written an address into a
 *   device's DMA register. There is no IOMMU on this machine. A device given a
 *   wrong physical address will DMA over kernel memory and no instruction check
 *   can see it happen.
 *
 *   The mitigations are worth listing exactly, because the difference between
 *   "mitigated" and "prevented" is the whole point:
 *     - only the one named target is made a bus master, and only by C;
 *     - the program is told exactly one valid buffer address and one size;
 *     - the arena is its own .bss object with 64 KiB of poisoned guard band
 *       either side, and dvm_dma_check() reports an overrun of up to that much
 *       as a fact with a byte offset, to the model and to the trace;
 *     - the values a program wrote into device registers are recorded twice, in
 *       two records with OPPOSITE blind spots, so the address it handed the
 *       hardware is usually — but NOT always — recoverable. Stated precisely,
 *       because this bullet is part of the argument for accepting the escalation
 *       and it used to claim "every value ... is in the access log", which is
 *       false:
 *         * g_log, which driver_run's tail and driver_trace read, is a RING of
 *           DRV_LOG_MAX (256) events against a budget of DRV_MAX_IO (1024). It
 *           keeps the LAST 256, so it loses the START of a long run;
 *         * the serial console trace in vm/dvm.c is bounded by max_trace (128 for
 *           trace=io, 256 for trace=all) and keeps the FIRST N, so it loses the
 *           END.
 *       A program that polls 200 times, then writes a wild descriptor address,
 *       then polls 300 more times (501 events — an ordinary bring-up shape, and
 *       inside budget) has that write in NEITHER record. driver_trace is honest at
 *       the point of use ("%lu events happened; the last %lu are kept"), and this
 *       comment now is too. Closing the hole needs the log to keep both ends
 *       rather than one, which is a bigger change than a constant.
 *
 *   A determined program can still compute a completely different 32-bit number
 *   and write it into a descriptor-base register, and that DMA will happen. This
 *   is the same trust any real kernel extends to a driver it loads. The honest
 *   description of this path is "a trusted driver, written this turn, whose
 *   register accesses are sandboxed and whose DMA is not".
 *
 * THE RETRY LOOP
 *   A first attempt is usually wrong, and the interesting question is what the
 *   model gets to see afterwards. It gets: the trap name, the message the VM
 *   wrote, the source LINE and its own text back, that instruction
 *   disassembled, the final register file, and the tail of an access log this
 *   file recorded by wrapping the I/O backend — every port, address, width and
 *   value, in order, as they really happened. That is enough to revise a
 *   program without guessing, and it is why the loop converges instead of
 *   flailing.
 *
 *   It is bounded. DRV_ATTEMPT_BUDGET consecutive failed runs against one
 *   target and the tool stops running programs there and says so; a run that
 *   reaches `halt` clears the count. Without that a confused model owns the
 *   machine for as many rounds as chat.c will give it, poking a device it does
 *   not understand. dvm_tools_reset_attempts() clears the table, and nothing in
 *   the kernel calls it yet — see FUTURE EXTENSION POINTS.
 *
 * UNTRUSTED INPUT
 *   `source` is a program written by a language model and arrives as a raw,
 *   non-NUL-terminated JSON span that may contain embedded NULs, 16 KB of
 *   nothing, or no newlines at all. It is decoded with json.h into a fixed
 *   buffer, passed to dvm_assemble() with an explicit length, and every
 *   structural bound belongs to the assembler. Numeric arguments are range
 *   checked here before they can become a budget. Nothing in this file
 *   allocates except the 12 KB program image, which is kmalloc'd and freed on
 *   every path.
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES
 *   dvm.h (assemble/policy/run), pci.h (config space — reads only), device.h
 *   (the registry that gives a device its NAME), json.h, trace.h, tool.h,
 *   kernel.h for kmalloc and the console.
 *
 * FUTURE EXTENSION POINTS
 *   - chat.c should call dvm_tools_reset_attempts() at the start of each
 *     operator turn, so a new sentence gets a fresh budget while a runaway
 *     model inside one turn still hits the wall. That is a one-line change in a
 *     file this one does not own.
 *   - A program that halts cleanly is a driver. Keeping the assembled image and
 *     re-entering it on demand (dvm.h's entry-point hook, which does not exist
 *     yet) is how a model-authored driver becomes resident rather than one-shot.
 *   - The third thing DMA wants and still does not have is a way to BOUND where a
 *     device may write. VT-d would give it: a domain whose only mapping is the
 *     arena turns a wrong descriptor address into a fault instead of corruption,
 *     and would let this file stop describing the DMA path as trust.
 *   - dvm_dma_check() runs once, after the run. A device that keeps mastering
 *     afterwards can dirty the guard band later and be blamed on the next run. A
 *     "stop everything this device was doing" path (clear the master bit and the
 *     device's own run bit) would need device knowledge the kernel refuses to
 *     have; the honest alternative is what happens now, which is to say so.
 *   - BAR sizes are inferred. A `pci_size_bar` operation that writes all-ones
 *     and restores, under an explicit lock, would make the windows exact.

/* THE WIRE BETWEEN "I BROUGHT THE CARD UP" AND "THE MACHINE CAN MAKE A SOUND".
 *
 * Why this exists. core/audio.c has had audio_register_vm() — a full, validated,
 * host-tested path for installing a model-authored play program as the machine's
 * audio sink — and nothing in the kernel called it. The consequence was not a
 * missing nicety: it was a dead end that a live model walked into. It found the
 * unclaimed card, brought it up correctly with driver_run, and then spent most of
 * a turn looking for the registration step that did not exist. driver_run leaves
 * a device configured and mastering; audio_tone needs a sink; there was no verb
 * that turned the first into the second. This tool is that verb.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, deliberately: it does not run the program. Registration
 * validates the image (dvm_program_validate) and the sandbox (dvm_policy_check),
 * so a corrupt program or an impossible policy is refused here, while the model
 * can still fix it. But "does this program actually drive the device" is a
 * question only a real sound can answer, and the kernel refuses to answer it by
 * running the program against an EMPTY buffer: at install time r9/r10/r11 would
 * all be zero, so a correct program would be asked to play nothing and could
 * only look broken. The first audio_tone is the test, and its failure carries the
 * program's own `abort` text back to the model.
 *
 * THE SANDBOX IS THE SAME ONE. build_sandbox() is shared with driver_run, so a
 * play program is granted exactly what a bring-up program was granted for that
 * device, and audio.c re-checks that the DMA grant starts at the arena base and
 * covers the PCM — which is what makes r7 mean the same thing in both programs.
 *
 * THE PRIVILEGE IS THE SAME ONE, and it is now PERMANENT rather than for the
 * length of one run. cmd_enable() sets bus mastering on the named function and
 * this tool does NOT take it back on success, because the sink is expected to
 * DMA on every note from here on. There is still no IOMMU: an installed play
 * program that computes a wrong address DMAs over kernel memory on every sound,
 * not once. dvm_dma_check() after each play turns a near miss into a failed
 * sound; a far miss is not detectable on this machine. See this file's header.
 *
 * The trace console is turned OFF for an installed program on purpose: a sink is
 * re-run for every note, and a per-access trace would bury the operator's
 * transcript in device I/O the moment an app starts beeping. The access log the
 * recorder keeps is left alone for the same reason — driver_trace must go on
 * showing the last driver_run, not whatever the last note did. */
