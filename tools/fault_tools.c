/* fault_tools.c — the fault-diagnosis and fault-recovery tool family.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   Let the model see what the CPU saw, and — since Phase 3b — let it decide
 *   what the machine should do about the next one. When this machine takes an
 *   exception, arch/x86_64/idt.c captures the whole machine state and renders a
 *   report; these tools hand that report, the decoded semantics behind it, and
 *   the ability to arm a recovery, to the model.
 *
 * THE TOOL SET
 *   fault_status        Has anything faulted? How many times, how long ago, and
 *                       what was it. Also reports whether the IDT is installed
 *                       at all, because "no faults" and "faults cannot be
 *                       caught" are very different answers to the same question
 *                       and only one of them is good news. Now also states what
 *                       recovery plan is armed and whether the machine is
 *                       repeating a fault at one address.
 *   fault_report        The full captured report for a fault: registers,
 *                       decoded error code, faulting instruction bytes,
 *                       backtrace, and what was decided. For the most recent
 *                       fault this is byte-identical to what the kernel printed
 *                       on the console — it is literally the same buffer. Older
 *                       faults are named by "seq" and re-rendered from the ring.
 *   fault_history       One line per retained fault. The index into the ring
 *                       the model needs before it can ask for a specific report.
 *   fault_decode        Decode an arbitrary (vector, error_code) pair without
 *                       any fault having happened, so the model can reason about
 *                       a code it read in a log or a manual.
 *   fault_recover       ARMS A RECOVERY DECISION. The only mutating tool here,
 *                       and the only tool in this kernel that can change what
 *                       the CPU executes next. TOOL_MUTATES.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * fault_recover: the model steering a CPU, and what stands in the way
 * ============================================================================
 *   Phase 3a deliberately shipped no recovery, on the grounds that writing to a
 *   live fault_frame_t and returning into it is strictly worse than halting if
 *   any field is wrong: the machine does not fault again, it executes something
 *   arbitrary with no record of why. That argument was right, and none of it has
 *   been repealed. What changed is that the frame is no longer patched on trust.
 *
 *   The decision is armed BEFORE a fault, never during one — a handler running
 *   with IF clear, on the interrupted stack, cannot go and ask the model
 *   anything. So this tool writes a fault_plan_t and nothing else; every field
 *   is re-validated inside the exception handler against the live frame, and the
 *   plan is refused there if anything does not hold. See fault.h for the five
 *   independent checks (#DF is never recoverable, every produced RIP must be
 *   inside the loaded image, "skip" needs a certain instruction length, plans
 *   are consumed by use, and repeated faults at one RIP stop the machine).
 *
 *   This tool's own job is the front line of that: reject anything malformed
 *   loudly and specifically, so the model gets a sentence it can act on rather
 *   than a fault it caused. Unknown keys are refused rather than ignored,
 *   because a plan the model believes it armed and the kernel silently dropped
 *   half of is the worst outcome available.
 *
 *   The injector remains unreachable from here. arch/x86_64/fault_inject.c
 *   registers no tool and is called from nowhere in a normal build: a machine
 *   whose only interface is natural language must not have a "crash yourself"
 *   verb one hallucination away from the model. Arming a recovery is safe
 *   precisely because it cannot cause a fault; it can only change the response
 *   to one that happens anyway.
 *
 *   Nothing here allocates. The whole family has to remain usable when the
 *   thing being diagnosed is the allocator, which is the same constraint
 *   tools/mem_tools.c works under and for the same reason.
 *
 * WHY THE RING MATTERS TO THIS FILE SPECIFICALLY
 *   fault_report used to hand back a pointer into the kernel's one static
 *   record. That was safe only while faults were terminal. Now that they are
 *   not, a fault taken during a fault_report call would have rewritten the
 *   record under its own caller — the answer would begin describing fault #1
 *   and end describing fault #2, with no seam and no way to tell. Records live
 *   in a ring keyed by seq, and this file always names the record it wants.
 *
 * WHAT PAIRS WITH THIS
 *   fault_report gives RIP, the bytes at RIP, and a backtrace. mem_read
 *   (tools/mem_tools.c) accepts exactly the window those addresses live in, so
 *   the model can follow a backtrace entry and read the code around it. That
 *   pairing is the actual diagnostic loop, and it is why mem_read's window was
 *   drawn where it was.
 *
 * UNTRUSTED INPUT
 *   fault_status and fault_history ignore their input entirely — the most
 *   robust possible parse. fault_report accepts an optional integer "seq".
 *   fault_decode validates through json.h only: "vector" must be an integer in
 *   [0, 255], "error_code" may be a bounded hex/decimal string or a
 *   non-negative integer and defaults to 0. fault_recover validates every field
 *   twice: for shape here, and for effect inside the handler.
 *
 * OUTPUT BOUNDS — AND A KNOWN SHORTFALL, MEASURED, NOT GUESSED
 *   These tools write into whatever buffer the caller supplies. Two different
 *   numbers are in play and they do not agree:
 *
 *     TOOL_RESULT_MAX      4096   include/tool.h, the family's nominal budget,
 *                                 and what FAULT_REPORT_MAX is sized against
 *                                 (include/fault.h: "fits TOOL_RESULT_MAX")
 *     CHAT_TOOL_RESULT_CAP 1024   include/chat.h — what net/chat.c ACTUALLY
 *                                 passes for every tool call in production
 *
 *   The longest report this file can emit is 1629 bytes (measured, and printed
 *   by tests/host/test_fault.c's "longest report:" line). So in the shipped
 *   kernel a full fault_report is cut at 1023 bytes and tool_dispatch overwrites
 *   the tail with its truncation notice — losing the end of the register block,
 *   `code @RIP`, the backtrace and the disposition, which is most of the
 *   diagnosis. fault_status after a fault is in the same position.
 *
 *   This is not fixed here because every available fix is a behaviour change or
 *   sits in another owner's file: raise CHAT_TOOL_RESULT_CAP (include/chat.h),
 *   or give fault_report an offset/lines argument the way read_file and
 *   driver_trace already have. Note also that the host tests build their result
 *   buffer from TOOL_RESULT_MAX, so they cannot see this — they measure a
 *   machine that does not ship. Recorded so the next reader does not conclude
 *   from FAULT_REPORT_MAX that the report fits.

/* THE MOST DANGEROUS TOOL IN THIS KERNEL, and it is worth being explicit about
 * why it exists anyway.
 *
 *   Every page here is RWX (boot/boot.asm never sets NX), so .text is as
 *   writable as .data. That makes "the machine fixed a bug in itself" reachable
 *   without a compiler, a linker or a reboot: a function is a byte string and
 *   the model can edit it. It is the cheapest route to genuine self-repair.
 *
 *   It is also the only tool whose mistakes do not fault. A wrong byte silently
 *   changes what the CPU does, forever, with no record — strictly worse than a
 *   crash, because a crash at least prints a report. So this tool contributes
 *   almost no policy of its own: it parses hex, refuses anything it cannot parse
 *   exactly, and hands the request to fault_patch_apply(), which runs the five
 *   gates documented in include/fault.h (inside .text, the expected bytes must
 *   actually be there, whole instructions out, whole instructions in, and the
 *   original always kept). One implementation of the rules, one place to read
 *   them, and the same rules whether a patch arrives from an operator turn or
 *   from the kernel's own fault diagnosis.
 *
 *   "expect" is REQUIRED and there is no flag to skip it. It is the only defence
 *   against an address that was correct in another build, and the only evidence
 *   available that the address is an instruction boundary at all.

     * because its explanatory comment was longer than this buffer. A patch is
     * bytes and an address; the note is decoration that gets stored beside them.
     * Refusing a correct repair over the length of its comment costs a round
     * trip, spends a paid API call, and burns one of the two per-boot patch
     * attempts to learn a buffer size. So an over-long note is truncated and the
     * patch is judged on its bytes. Contrast "expect" and "bytes" immediately
     * above, where a clipped value would be a DIFFERENT instruction and refusing
     * is the only safe answer. */
