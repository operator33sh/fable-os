/* app_impl.h — the compiled form of an app document. Internal to apps/.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 *   include/app.h is the contract the rest of the kernel and the model's tools
 *   see. This header is the representation those two files agree on: what a
 *   document turns INTO once it has been validated, and the seam between
 *   apps/expr.c (values, numbers, expressions — pure arithmetic and text, no GUI)
 *   and apps/runtime.c (documents, widgets, statements, windows).
 *
 *   It is a private header on purpose. Nothing outside apps/ should be able to
 *   build an app by hand: app_launch() is the only way in, so the only code that
 *   can produce these structures is the code that validates them.
 *   tests/host/test_app.c includes it directly, which is how the evaluator is
 *   tested as a unit rather than only through a window.
 *
 * WHY POSTFIX
 *   Expressions are compiled at LOAD time into a flat postfix op list with a
 *   pre-computed stack high-water mark. Three properties fall out of that, all of
 *   which matter on a kernel with no memory protection:
 *     1. Evaluation is a loop over an array with no recursion, so a hostile
 *        "((((((..." costs stack in the COMPILER (bounded by APP_PAREN_DEPTH and
 *        rejected with a message) and none at all in the evaluator.
 *     2. Every name is resolved to an index while the document is being checked,
 *        so a typo is a load error with a byte offset instead of a lookup failure
 *        on the tenth click.
 *     3. The stack bound is proved before the app runs, not defended at runtime.
 *
 * EVERY OPERATION IS TOTAL
 *   There is no failure path out of eval(): division by zero, overflow, a string
 *   in an arithmetic slot and num("abc") all produce the ERR value, which
 *   propagates. See DECISION 2 in include/app.h.

 * a fresh reading. Two reasons, both load-bearing:
 *   - `hour` and `minute` in one handler must not straddle a minute boundary and

 *     that event agree.
 *   - the wall clock is a device (CMOS port I/O). Reading it per operand would
 *     put unbounded-ish I/O inside the evaluator; reading it at most once per
 *     event, and only if the document actually mentions it, keeps evaluation the
 *     flat arithmetic loop it is documented to be.
 * Returns 1 when *wall is a usable reading, 0 when this machine has no readable
 * wall clock (then every wall-clock leaf is ERR). *ms is always set.
 *
 * app_env_random() returns 64 fresh bits from the machine's entropy source
