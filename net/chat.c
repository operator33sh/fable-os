/* THIS NUMBER DECIDES WHETHER THE MODEL CAN AUTHOR AN APP AT ALL, and it was
 * 1024 tokens, which is why it could not.
 *
 * A live session found it the only way it can be found. "I want a window that
 * says hello only" worked first try (a 128-byte document). "I want a calculator"
 * then failed FIFTEEN rounds in a row, every one of them
 * `[app action=launch -> EINVAL]`, with the model saying "I keep failing to
 * attach the document" and attaching it every time. It was not lying and the
 * tool was not wrong: a calculator document is ~4 KiB of dense JSON (see
 * apps/examples/calculator.json, 4058 bytes), the API stopped generating at
 * max_tokens while still inside the tool_use block, and a tool_use cut off
 * mid-arguments comes back with `"input":{}`. The kernel then correctly reported
 * that "document" was missing — an error the model could not act on, because
 * from where it stood it had sent one. That is a money-burning infinite loop
 * whose cause is invisible from both ends, and no mock can reproduce it.
 *
 * WHY 3072 AND NOT MORE. The reply lands in three fixed buffers:
 *   - CHAT_RESP_BYTES (65536) holds the whole HTTP response: never the binding
 *     constraint here.
 *   - CHAT_HISTORY_BYTES (16384) must hold the assistant turn VERBATIM, because
 *     a tool_use block has to be echoed back byte for byte next round. This is
 *     the real ceiling. 3072 tokens cannot exceed 12288 bytes even at a
 *     pessimistic 4 bytes per token, which still fits one turn in the history
 *     with room for the tool_result that answers it. 4096 tokens does not carry
 *     that guarantee.
 *   - CHAT_REQ_BYTES (61440) is unaffected: what goes out is bounded by the
 *     history arena, not by this number.
 * It is also 3x the room the largest documented app document needs, so the
 * headline case has slack rather than sitting on the edge.
 *
 * Raising it further is not free: it is the one constant that lets a single
 * assistant turn stop fitting the history at all, which aborts the round
 * (CHAT_EHISTORY) instead of merely truncating it. If you raise it, raise
 * CHAT_HISTORY_BYTES in the same commit and re-check chat.h's request
 * arithmetic. The paired safety net is in run_turn(): a turn that DOES get cut
 * off mid-call is now named as such to the model instead of being reported as
 * missing arguments. */

/* ====================================================================== */

/* THE SYSTEM PROMPT IS PART OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM.
 *
 * It is the only place the model is told what machine it is running, and the
 * operator's whole experience turns on whether it is specific. "Be helpful and
 * use your tools" produces a model that narrates plausible kernel work; a prompt
 * that states this kernel's actual constraints produces one that inspects,
 * mutates, reads the result back and reports what really happened. So every
 * sentence below is a fact about THIS build, checkable against the source:
 *
 *   - single-threaded, ring 0, IF=0, all PIC lines masked, everything polled:
 *     boot/boot.asm, arch/x86_64/idt.c, kernel/main.c's loop. Nothing preempts
 *     anything, so nobody else is ever to blame.
 *   - TWO filesystems, and the model must not confuse them. "/" is RAM-backed
 *     (fs/native/ramfs.c) and is gone on the next boot; "/disk" is FAT32 on a
 *     real disk (fs/fat/, drivers/block/) and survives a power cycle, and it is
 *     where core/capability.c and core/agenda.c keep their stores when a disk is
 *     attached. Whether one IS attached is a run-time fact, so the prompt states
 *     the RULE and points at the tool result that states the FACT - a capability
 *     or agenda tool always names its store and says whether it is durable.
 *
 *     THIS PARAGRAPH IS LOAD-BEARING AND IT WAS WRONG FOR A WHOLE BRANCH. The
 *     prompt used to say, flatly, "the filesystem is real but lives in RAM, so
 *     anything you write is gone on the next boot". Asked live what would still
 *     be there after a power cycle, the model called capability_list, was told
 *     "store /disk/cap (survives a reboot)", and then CORRECTED THE KERNEL: it
 *     invented a distinction between a reboot and a power-off and told the
 *     operator that nothing persists and that an agenda item would not help
 *     either. Every word of that came from this comment's own stale sentence.
 *     A prompt that contradicts a tool result does not merely fail to help; the
 *     model believes the prompt, so the capability is DENIED TO THE OPERATOR
 *     while the machine has it. If a subsystem's contract changes, this string
 *     is part of that subsystem's contract.
 *   - the machine is no longer idle between sentences: core/fiber.c's ui fiber
 *     paints during a model turn and core/agenda.c runs scheduled work with
 *     nobody typing, so "nothing happens in the background" is no longer true
 *     and the prompt says what does.
 *   - still true, and the model must not pretend otherwise: no package manager
 *     and no loader, so nothing built off this machine can be brought in.
 *
 *     THIS ONE WENT STALE TOO, AND IT IS THE SAME DEFECT AS THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE.
 *     It used to end "no C compiler ... new code is authored in the driver VM's
 *     ISA and nowhere else", which stopped being true the moment compiler/ and
 *     tools/cc_tools.c landed: cc_compile builds real C into native x86-64 in
 *     this kernel and runs it. Asked live "can you compile real C, or only the
 *     little VM instruction set?", the model happened to trust the tool list
 *     over the prompt and proved it by compiling something (2/2 observed) - but
 *     that is luck, not design, and it is exactly the shape of the failure that
 *     denied GUI apps to the operator for a branch. The prompt now names both
 *     authoring paths and says which is for what: the VM reaches hardware and
 *     is bounded to a few hundred instructions (DVM_MAX_INSNS), the compiler is
 *     for arithmetic, strings, arrays and loops. Both clauses are conditional
 *     on the tool being offered, so this stays true in a build without one.
 *   - the tool list is the whole syscall surface: tools[] in this request IS
 *     tool.h's registry, assembled from it (core/tool.c), so "I do not have a
 *     tool for that" is a checkable statement and inventing a name is not.
 *   - trace lines are emitted by the kernel in C after each call returns
 *     (lib/trace.c) and a '[' in column zero cannot be produced by prose
 *     (print_model_prose below). Telling the model this is not a threat, it is
 *     information: claiming an action it did not take is not merely wrong, it is
 *     visibly wrong to the operator, and honest failure is strictly better.
 *   - the round budget is real and finite, and the loop reports how much is
 *     left after each round (see the kernel note in blocks_buf).
 *
 * The one thing this prompt must keep verbatim is its opening clause, which
 * tests/host/test_chat.c pins as "the machine tells the model what it is".

static const char SYSTEM_PROMPT[] =
    "You are the resident intelligence of fable-os, a bare-metal x86-64 kernel. "
    "You are not an assistant running on the machine: you ARE its user "
    "interface. There is no shell, no commands, no filesystem browser and no "
    "other way for the operator to drive this computer. A sentence typed at the "
    "prompt is the only input; your tool calls are the only way anything "
    "happens.\n"

    "\nTHE MACHINE. One CPU, ring 0, single-threaded, no userspace, no "
    "processes, no memory protection: every tool call runs in the kernel's own "
    "address space and finishes before the next one starts. Interrupts are "
    "masked and all hardware is polled, so nothing preempts anything - but two "
    "things do run while nobody is asking: a cooperative fiber keeps the screen "
    "and the GUI apps painted, so an app's periodic \"tick\" handler keeps "
    "running between turns and even during your own API call, and the kernel's "
    "agenda runs scheduled work with nobody typing. Memory is one heap in a "
    "fixed arena. There is no package manager and no loader, so you cannot bring "
    "in a program built somewhere else - but you can WRITE code here and run it, "
    "and that is how this machine gains an ability it was not built with. Two "
    "ways: the driver VM's own instruction set, which is what reaches hardware "
    "(ports, MMIO, DMA) and is bounded to a few hundred instructions; and, if a "
    "compile tool is offered, real C compiled inside this kernel to native "
    "x86-64 and executed here, which is the one to reach for when the job is "
    "arithmetic, strings, arrays or loops rather than a device.\n"

    "\nWHERE THINGS LIVE, AND WHAT SURVIVES A POWER CYCLE. There are two "
    "filesystems and the difference is the difference between work you keep and "
    "work you lose. Everything under \"/\" is RAM-backed and is gone on the next "
    "boot; /tmp is scratch. \"/disk\" is a real FAT32 volume on a real disk: a "
    "file written there is still there after the machine is switched off and on, "
    "and so are saved capabilities and the agenda. Not every machine has a disk, "
    "so this is a fact you READ rather than assume - a capability or agenda tool "
    "always names its store and says whether it is durable, and that result is "
    "the truth. Never contradict it from memory, and never explain it away: if a "
    "tool says the store survives a reboot, it survives being switched off too. "
    "Put anything worth keeping under /disk, and when there is no disk say "
    "plainly that the work will be lost.\n"

    "\nWHAT YOU CAN DO. Exactly the tools listed in this request, and nothing "
    "else. That list is the kernel's tool registry, assembled from it "
    "mechanically - it is not a summary, so if a capability is not in it, this "
    "machine genuinely does not have it. Never invent a tool name; if you get "
    "one wrong the kernel replies with the real list, so read it and correct "
    "yourself. Say plainly when a request is outside the surface, and name the "
    "closest thing you do have.\n"

    "\nYOU CAN BUILD GUI APPS, AND THAT IS EASY TO MISS. If an app tool is "
    "offered, this machine has no fixed catalogue of applications: you WRITE one "
    "as a JSON document - labels, buttons, fields, and handlers with a small "
    "expression language - and launch it into a real clickable window, so "
    "\"I want a stopwatch\", \"a tip calculator\" or \"a window that just says "
    "hello\" is something you author in one tool call rather than something this "
    "machine lacks. Any built-in app list you see elsewhere is a couple of "
    "prebuilt demos, NOT the limit; so offer to build the thing asked for "
    "instead of substituting the nearest demo, and if the first document is "
    "rejected the error carries a working skeleton - fix it and launch again.\n"

    "\nYOU CAN KEEP WHAT YOU BUILD, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS MACHINE. If a "
    "capability tool is offered, a program you write can be SAVED under a name "
    "with a one-line description and then CALLED by name - later in this "
    "conversation, and after a reboot, because the store is on the disk. So look "
    "before you build: the list of what this machine has already been taught is "
    "carried in the capability tool's own description and there is a tool that "
    "lists it in full, so call what is there instead of writing it again. "
    "Rebuilding something this machine already knows is the failure the operator "
    "will notice first. And when you have just solved something they are likely "
    "to ask for twice, save it, say that you did, and say what it is called. A "
    "compiled C program keeps the same way, in its own store with its own list, "
    "so a routine worth calling twice should be given a name rather than typed "
    "out again.\n"

    "\nYOU CAN ACT WITHOUT BEING ASKED, AND REPAIR YOURSELF. If an agenda tool "
    "is offered you can schedule a tool call or a whole sentence to run at boot, "
    "once, or on a period, and it is kept with the disk - that is the honest "
    "answer to \"do this every time you start up\", rather than promising to "
    "remember. If a fetch tool is offered you can reach the network yourself, not "
    "just the model transport. And when the CPU faults the machine survives it "
    "and asks you what happened; if a patch tool is offered you can rewrite an "
    "instruction in this running kernel's .text and undo it again. None of this "
    "needs the operator present, so when a request is really \"and keep doing "
    "it\", schedule it.\n"

    "\nHOW TO WORK. Treat a request as a job to finish, not a question to "
    "answer. Look before you act: read the current state, then change one thing "
    "at a time. AFTER EVERY CHANGE, READ IT BACK with a tool - list the "
    "directory you wrote into, stat the file, re-read the device state, dump the "
    "bytes. A tool result saying 'ok' is evidence the call returned, not that "
    "the system is in the state the operator wanted. Do not assume, and do not "
    "stop early: keep calling tools until the job is actually done. You have a "
    "limited number of tool rounds per sentence and the kernel tells you after "
    "each round how many are left; plan inside that budget and answer before it "
    "runs out. If a plan tool is offered, write the checklist down before you "
    "start anything that takes more than two steps and mark the steps off as you "
    "verify them: that record is kept by the kernel, so it is also how you pick "
    "up a job that was cut short - read it back and carry on rather than "
    "starting again.\n"

    "\nWHEN SOMETHING FAILS. A failed call is information, not a dead end. The "
    "error text says what was wrong - read it, fix the argument or the "
    "assumption, and try the corrected call. A missing parent directory means "
    "create it; a rejected value means the range is different from what you "
    "guessed; a device in the wrong state means look at its state first. Retry "
    "differently, never identically. If it still cannot be done, say exactly "
    "which step failed and what the kernel said.\n"

    "\nHONESTY. The kernel prints its own [bracketed] trace line for every tool "
    "call, in C, from the real return value, after the call returned. Those "
    "lines are the operator's only proof of what happened, and nothing you write "
    "can produce one - a bracket at the start of your line gets moved. So a "
    "claim you did not earn does not fool anybody, it just costs the operator "
    "their trust. Report partial success as partial, report failure as failure, "
    "and never describe what a tool would do instead of calling it.\n"

    "\nTELEGRAM. When a sentence begins with \"Telegram message from\", it came "
    "from a real Telegram user via the bridge, not from the console operator. "
    "The chat_id is in the sentence. Always reply by calling telegram_send with "
    "that chat_id and a short, plain-text answer — never just print prose to the "
    "screen. If telegram_send is not in the tool list, say so and explain why.\n"

    "\nVOICE. The operator can already see the trace lines, so do not narrate "
    "the mechanics. Answer in one or two plain sentences: what is now true, and "
    "anything that is still broken or unverified. No lists, no markdown, no "
    "restating the question.";

 * say so was abandoned. That is the worst outcome this file can produce.
 *
 * WHAT IS SAFE TO DROP, exactly. The turn's messages are [the operator's
 * sentence, then (assistant with tool_use, user with its tool_result) pairs].
 * Dropping one WHOLE ADJACENT PAIR keeps every invariant the API needs: the
 * first message is still the user's sentence, roles still alternate, and no
 * tool_use is left without its tool_result (a dangling one is a 400 from the
 * API, which would cost the operator the turn as surely as running out of room).
 * The pair dropped is the oldest, which is the least useful: it is the attempt
 * the model has already moved on from, while the errors it is actually working
 * from are the most recent ones.

 * tools_build_schema() COPIES those descriptions into tools_buf, so a one-shot

 *
 * The consequence was worse than a stale list: with an empty store at boot the
 * panel reads "NONE SAVED YET - this machine has not been taught anything
 * beyond its built-in tools", and that sentence stayed in the model's own
 * instructions for the whole session, immediately after it had saved something.
 * An actively false statement in the tool schema, contradicted by the
 * tool_result still sitting in the history. Only a power cycle fixed it, which
 * is exactly why a boot-2 observation made the mechanism look like it worked.
 *
 * REBUILDING IS SAFE AND CHEAP, and both halves are load-bearing. Safe because
 * the panels are FIXED WIDTH by construction — space-padded, no quote, no
 * backslash, no control byte — so the serialised schema is byte-for-byte the
 * same size with 0, 1 or 16 entries saved, which
 * tests/host/test_capability.c and tests/host/test_cc.c both assert. Cheap
 * because this runs once per operator sentence, not once per round, against a
 * network round trip that costs three orders of magnitude more.
 *
 * AND A FAILED REBUILD KEEPS THE LAST GOOD SCHEMA. Zeroing tools_len offers the
 * model NO TOOLS AT ALL — a machine that boots, talks, and can do nothing —

/* The model's voice: plain prose, no prefix. Always ends on a fresh line so a

 *
 * FORGERY RESISTANCE — this is the model's largest uncontrolled output channel.
 *   trace.c escapes brackets and control bytes in the argument and op fields of
 *   a trace line, so a hostile *path* cannot fabricate kernel output. But the
 *   reply text printed here is entirely model-chosen, and a bare kputs() of it
 *   would let the model simply TYPE
 *
 *       [vfs_write /etc/shadow bytes=9999 -> ok]
 *
 *   producing bytes indistinguishable from genuine ground truth. That would
 *   defeat the whole point of the trace mechanism, since the operator has no
 *   `ls` with which to check.
 *
 *   The invariant this function enforces is the cheapest one that cannot be
 *   talked around: A KERNEL TRACE LINE IS A '[' IN COLUMN ZERO. Model prose is
 *   never allowed to put one there — a '[' that would land in column zero gets a
 *   single leading space. Prose is otherwise untouched, so the model can still
 *   write about brackets, quote a trace line back, or use them mid-sentence;
 *   it just cannot occupy the one position that means "the kernel says so".
 *
 *   TWO WAYS THAT INVARIANT WAS ESCAPED, AND WHY IT IS NOW WRITTEN LIKE THIS.
 *   The first version of this function tracked line starts itself, with
 *   `at_line_start = (c == '\n')`. That is a MODEL of the console, and the
 *   console disagreed with it in three places (all reproduced against this
 *   function, all now regression-tested in tests/host/test_chat.c):
 *
 *     1. '\r' — kputc() resets the column on a carriage return, and json.c
 *        decodes "\r" into a raw 0x0D. `x\r[vfs_write ... -> ok]` therefore put
 *        a byte-exact forgery in column zero.
 *     2. '\b' — kputc() steps the cursor left, and from column zero it steps UP
 *        a row. So backspaces reach column zero, and enough of them walk back
 *        into a GENUINE trace line printed earlier and overwrite it. That is
 *        worse than forgery: it is erasure.
 *     3. wrap — printing in the last column returns the cursor to column zero
 *        with no newline involved at all. Exactly 80 printable characters of
 *        prose, then '[', and the forgery lands.
 *
 *   Both halves of the fix follow from those. First, prose does not get to move
 *   the cursor: every C0 control byte except '\n' and '\t' is escaped as \xNN,
 *   the same way lib/trace.c sanitizes an argument. Prose is text, not
 *   cursor control, and a reply has no legitimate reason to emit a carriage
 *   return. Second, the column is not modelled, it is ASKED FOR —
 *   console_cursor() is the console's own count, so wrap, scroll, tabs and any
 *   future console change are covered by construction rather than by a rule
 *   here that has to be kept in sync. lib/base.c owns the console; it owns the
 *   column too.

 * stop_reason "max_tokens" used to be reported only on a round with no tool
 * calls, on the argument that the operator should only be interrupted by facts
 * they can act on. But generation stops wherever it stops, and the last block of
 * a truncated reply is usually the tool_use itself: the API then hands back that
 * block with `"input":{}`, because a half-written arguments object is not JSON.
 * Every tool in this kernel then answers, correctly and uselessly, that its
 * required argument is missing.
 *
 * A live session showed exactly what that costs: fifteen consecutive rounds of
 * `[app action=launch -> EINVAL]` while the model insisted it was attaching a
 * document it really was attaching, each round a paid API call. Neither end
 * could see the truncation, because the one party that knew — the kernel, which
 * had the stop_reason in its hand — was staying quiet.
 *
 * So a call whose arguments arrived empty on a truncated reply is NOT dispatched
 * (dispatching it can only produce a misleading error, and for a mutating tool
 * it could act on defaults nobody asked for). It is answered with the real
 * reason, in words that name the remedy. The kernel prints its own line too, and
 * that line contains no model-chosen bytes: the tool NAME is model-controlled
 * and a '[' in column zero must stay unforgeable (include/trace.h), so the count
 * is printed and the name is not. */
