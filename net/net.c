/* net.c — lwIP netif driver for the e1000, plus the TLS transport that carries
 * the model protocol to api.anthropic.com.
 *
 * The kernel does TLS itself (mbedTLS via lwIP's altcp_tls layer), so there is
 * no host proxy: we DNS-resolve api.anthropic.com, open a TLS connection on 443
 * (with SNI), POST /v1/messages, and hand the response body back up.
 *
 * CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION is a build-time choice, default OFF.
 *
 *   plain `make`                         the historical behaviour: no CA chain,
 *                                        MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_NONE. The server's
 *                                        certificate is parsed and then
 *                                        believed. Encrypted, not
 *                                        authenticated, and MITM-able by
 *                                        anything that can answer on 443.
 *   `make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DFABLEOS_VERIFY_CERTS`
 *                                        the chain must build to one of the
 *                                        roots pinned in net/tls_ca.c, the
 *                                        certificate must name the host we
 *                                        asked for, and notBefore/notAfter must
 *                                        contain the CMOS clock's idea of now.
 *
 * Every FABLEOS_VERIFY_CERTS block below is additive; with the flag absent this
 * file compiles to exactly what it did before. See include/tls_ca.h for which
 * roots are trusted, why those, and what breaks when they rotate.
 *
 * The request is HTTP/1.0 so the response is close-delimited (no chunked
 * encoding to parse). We buffer the whole response, split off the headers, and
 * return the body.
 *
 * LAYERING — this file is deliberately the *only* place that knows about lwIP:
 *
 *     net_ask()            prompt -> JSON -> print       (protocol, no sockets)
 *       model_build_request()  net/model.c   builds & escapes the request body
 *       model_send()           net/model.c   dispatches through a transport
 *         tls_send()           here          HTTP/1.0 over altcp_tls
 *       json_msg_text()        net/json.c    reads the reply
 *
 * Swap model_tls_transport() for model_mock_transport() and the exact same
 * net_ask() logic runs on the host with no network — which is how the tool-use
 * loop will be tested.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ONE CONNECTION ENGINE, TWO USERS.
 * ============================================================================
 * There is a second user of everything below: tools/net_tools.c, the model's
 * general "fetch a URL" verb, through the seam in include/fetch.h. It is NOT a
 * second copy of any of this. http_exchange() below is the whole
 * connect/handshake/pump/receive/teardown machine, parameterised by destination,
 * SNI and whether TLS is used at all, and both the model transport and a general
 * fetch call it:
 *
 *     tls_send()        Anthropic framing (x-api-key!)  -> http_exchange()
 *     fetch_exchange()  arbitrary framing, no secrets   -> http_exchange()
 *
 * That matters for more than duplication. The generation-stamped callbacks, the
 * single teardown, the ERR_MEM-aware tx_pump and the "a stale connection must
 * never write this request's body" rule below were all learned the hard way, and
 * a second implementation would have had to learn them again. It also matters
 * for the secret: the engine takes an ALREADY-ASSEMBLED request buffer, so the
 * x-api-key header exists in exactly one function in this tree, and a fetch has
 * no code path that could grow one. See DECISION 2 in include/fetch.h.

/* THE YIELD POINT THAT MATTERS.
 *
 * Every wait in this file is `while (!done && millis() < deadline)
 * net_service();`, and a model turn spends seconds in one of them. Before
 * fibers, those seconds were the whole machine: the pointer froze, windows
 * stopped repainting and an app's tick handler stopped running. Adding
 * fiber_yield() here is what makes an API call something the machine does
 * rather than something it suffers.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT FIX, so nobody reads more into it than is there: the
 * KEYBOARD is still unserviced during a turn. Only input_poll() drains it and
 * that is called from kernel/main.c's wait_for_sentence(), i.e. from the fiber
 * that is sitting in this loop. Characters typed mid-turn still queue in the
 * 8042 and appear when the turn ends, exactly as before. Moving the drain into
 * the ui fiber would give one device two owners racing for individual
 * keystrokes, which is a worse bug than a late echo; the fix is a keyboard
 * fiber that owns the port outright, and that is not this change.
 *
 * WHY *HERE* AND NOT INSIDE THE CALLERS' LOOPS. This is the one place where
 * every network wait passes through a point at which lwIP is quiescent:
 * net_poll_rx() has returned every pbuf it took to netif->input, and
 * sys_check_timeouts() has finished running the timer list. Nothing is
 * half-modified, no pbuf is held, no pcb is mid-callback. Yield one line
 * earlier — between those two calls, or from inside a callback — and another
 * fiber could observe lwIP in a state NO_SYS=1 says cannot exist.
 *
 * WHAT THE OTHER FIBER MAY NOT DO: touch the network, and — learned the hard way
 * — touch HARDWARE OF ANY KIND that can block. Nothing in this kernel calls into
 * lwIP except this file, and the ui fiber's whole body is app_tick_handlers() +
 * gui_tick(), neither of which can reach a socket (include/app.h limits an app to
 * the widget expression language plus one brokered capability call).
 *
 * It used to call app_tick(), which ends with app_service() — the one function in
 * apps/ that reaches a driver — so a model-authored document with a periodic
 * handler could make the machine play a sound from inside this loop. audio.h's
 * play path is synchronous, so lwIP went unpolled for the length of it, in the
 * middle of a TLS round trip; and apps/cap.c's stated safety argument ("nothing
 * is started during a model turn") quietly stopped being true. Splitting the pump
 * out of the handlers fixed it, in apps/runtime.c and kernel/main.c.
 *
 * If a future fiber ever wants the network, it needs its own transport state, not
 * a second caller of these statics — see the cur_pcb comment below for what
 * sharing them costs.
 *
 * COST WHEN NOTHING ELSE IS RUNNABLE: one compare and a return. */

 * request's body — x-api-key header included — into a connection the kernel has
 * already given up on, its late data would interleave into the new response
 * buffer, and its FIN would set ask_done and return a half-read reply as real.
 *
 * So: cur_pcb is the pcb this file is still responsible for, NULL once lwIP owns
 * it, and tls_send() drops any survivor before it returns. tls_gen is belt and
 * braces — it stamps each attempt onto its pcb's arg so a callback can prove it

 * err_cb would re-enter this file and print "[net error ...]" for a connection
 * we are deliberately discarding. With the callbacks cleared, lwIP frees it
 * silently.
 *
 * Abort, not close: altcp_close() can fail with ERR_MEM when no pbuf is

/* Print server-chosen bytes without letting them forge kernel ground truth.
 *
 * A KERNEL TRACE LINE IS A '[' IN COLUMN ZERO, and both things net_ask() prints
 * are chosen by the far end: the model's reply text, and — when the reply is not
 * a message at all — the raw HTTP body. With certificate verification off by
 * default, "the far end" is anything that can answer on 443. A bare kputs() of
 * either let a reply of "[heap_free 0x1000 -> ok]" put a line on the console
 * that is byte-identical to genuine kernel output, during the boot self-test,
 * on a machine with no shell to check it against.
 *
 * So: C0 control bytes other than '\n' and '\t' are escaped (a '\r' resets the
 * console column and a '\b' walks back into a real trace line printed earlier,
 * so cursor motion is not something untrusted text gets to do), and a '[' that
 * would land in column zero is given one leading space. The column is asked for
 * rather than modelled, because wrap and scroll reach column zero with no
 * newline involved.
 *
 * This is deliberately the same rule as net/chat.c's print_model_prose(), which
 * carries the full derivation and the regression tests. The duplication is not
 * wanted: net_ask() is itself a weaker copy of the turn loop and the fix for
 * both is to delete it and make the boot self-test a chat_ask() call, which
 * needs kernel/main.c and chat.c. Reported rather than done. */
