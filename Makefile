# ===========================================================================
# THE API KEY IS NOT A BUILD INPUT
#
# It used to be: `-DFABLEOS_API_KEY='"$(KEY)"'` put the live secret inside
# net.o, kernel.elf, kernel.bin, fableos.iso AND .build-flags (which recorded
# the flag set verbatim, i.e. `KEY=sk-ant-...` in plain text). Five artifacts,
# kept out of git by a .gitignore — one `git add -f`, one CI cache, one shared
# build directory and the key is published. That is the wrong place for a
# safety property, so the hazard is gone rather than ignored: there is no KEY
# variable and no -D anywhere below, and `grep -r sk-ant` over every build
# output finds nothing because the compiler is never told.
#
# The key now travels host -> guest at RUN time over QEMU's fw_cfg channel and
# lives only in RAM. See the run targets (KEY_ARGS) and drivers/fwcfg/.
#
# Refuse KEY= loudly rather than ignore it: silently dropping a key someone
# believes they passed produces a kernel that gets 401 and an operator who
# does not know why.
# ===========================================================================
#
# Test $(origin KEY), NOT $(KEY). Make imports the environment as make
# variables, so a plain `ifneq ($(strip $(KEY)),)` also fires when KEY merely
# happens to be exported in the caller's shell — which is exactly what happens
# when a zsh/bash dotenv plugin auto-sources .env on cd. The operator then
# gets told "KEY= is gone" for a command they never typed, with a key sitting
# correctly in the file the message tells them to use. Only a command-line
# assignment is a mistake worth stopping the build for.
ifeq ($(origin KEY),command line)
$(error KEY= on the command line is gone: the API key is never compiled in. Put \
KEY="sk-ant-..." in .env (gitignored) and run `make run` — it is handed to the \
guest at boot over fw_cfg. See the README section "The API key never enters the \
build".)

#   headers   Editing include/mbedtls_config.h or port/lwipopts.h rebuilt
#             nothing, so the defines that switch certificate verification on
#             never reached the mbedTLS and lwIP objects that consume them.
#             -MMD -MP above emits a .d per object; they are included below.
#
#   flags     `make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DFABLEOS_VERIFY_CERTS` in an already-built tree
#             printed "Nothing to be done" and left the previous kernel in
#             place. Worse, recompiling ONE object without the flag afterwards
#             produced a kernel that verified nothing and still printed
#             "[tls] verified: chain trusted".
#
# HOW THAT IS ENFORCED, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN ORDINARY PREREQUISITE.
#
# The obvious shape — every object depends on a stamp holding the flags, and the
# stamp is rewritten when they change — DOES NOT WORK with the make this project
# is built with. /usr/bin/make here is GNU Make 3.81 (Apple's), whose
# is-the-prerequisite-newer test has WHOLE-SECOND granularity. The stamp is
# rewritten at the start of the new build, i.e. almost always inside the same
# wall-clock second as the tail of the previous build's objects, so those objects
# compare as up to date and are silently NOT recompiled. Measured: 51 to 184 of
# 184 objects skipped, non-deterministically, and a second identical make then
# recompiles ZERO, so the mixed-flag kernel is permanent until `make clean`. The
# worst observed outcome was an exit-0 build that recorded VERIFY_CERTS in the
# stamp while ten of the twelve flag-sensitive objects were still the
# non-verifying ones — precisely the failure the stamp was added to prevent, and
# it also hides the link error that a genuinely flagged build would surface.
#
# So the check does not rely on mtimes at all. It runs at PARSE time, before the
# dependency graph is built, and DELETES the objects the flag change invalidates.
# Deletion is a fact; mtime ordering is a guess. The cost is that alternating
# flag sets always pays a full rebuild — which is the honest price, and this tree
# builds clean in a couple of seconds.
#
# This stamp used to hold `KEY=sk-ant-...` in plain text, which made an
# untracked build artifact the second-easiest place to find the key. There is no
# KEY any more, so there is nothing secret in here to leak.
# Parse-time work must not happen under `make -n`: a dry run has to be free of
# side effects, or it stops being a way to find out what a build WOULD do.
# GNU Make puts the dry-run flag in the first word of MAKEFLAGS.

# is not an option: it puts the secret in QEMU's argv, where `ps` shows it to
# every user on the machine, and where it lands in shell history. So the key is
# written to a file created by mktemp — mode 0600, in $TMPDIR, i.e. OUTSIDE the
# repository and outside anything `make iso` copies into an image — and removed
# however the run ends: normal exit, a QEMU that refused to start, or the Ctrl-C
# that is how you actually leave `make run`. The only way to leave it behind is
# SIGKILL on the shell, which no trap anywhere can catch.
#
# That trap is why every keyed run target is ONE shell command with no `exec`:
# `exec` replaces the shell and takes its EXIT trap with it, and a second recipe
# line would be a second shell that never had the trap. Do not split them.
#
# The key is read inside the recipe's shell and never into a make variable: a
# make variable is visible in `make -p`, is exported to every sub-make, and gets

# ===========================================================================
FABLEOS_ENV ?= .env

# WHICH LINE OF .env IS THE KEY. Two rules, both learned the hard way.
#
#   1. The NAME IS MATCHED EXACTLY, against a two-name allowlist. This pattern
#      used to be `[A-Z_]*KEY`, i.e. any variable whose name ends in KEY, with
#      `tail -n 1` picking the LAST match. A .env file is conventionally shared
#      across a project and holds several credentials, so `KEY=sk-ant-...`
#      followed by `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...` sent the AWS secret to
#      api.anthropic.com in the x-api-key header — and the plainly realistic
#      `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` / `OPENAI_API_KEY=` pair is alphabetical, so the
#      OpenAI key won. Nothing surfaced it: fwcfg prints a byte count by design,
#      so the boot log said "32 bytes loaded" and then 401, indistinguishable
#      from a typo. Exfiltrating someone else's credential to a third party is
#      not an acceptable failure mode for a misnamed variable.
#
#   2. ORDER IN THE FILE DOES NOT DECIDE ANYTHING. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY wins over
#      KEY because it is the more specific name, not because of where it sits,
#      and `head -n 1` makes a repeated name deterministic too.
#
# Any other *KEY= line is named (NEVER printed) so the operator learns their
# other credential was ignored rather than silently transmitted.
#
# `set +x +v` is the first thing in the recipe, before `key=` is ever assigned.
# On macOS /bin/sh is bash in POSIX mode, and bash honours an INHERITED
# SHELLOPTS: with `export SHELLOPTS=xtrace` in the environment (a CI image, a
# debugging developer) every command below is traced to stderr with the value
# expanded, so `make run 2>&1 | tee build.log` puts the live key in a log file
# four times over. One token prevents it.

# unreadable is far more likely to be data somebody wants than a mistake.

# see. The image is gitignored for size and churn, not for secrecy.

# `clean` deliberately does NOT delete it: it is the machine's accumulated

# Nine suites rest their central claim on a sanitizer — test_tool.c's "ASan
# proves it" and "ASan's redzones catch any write outside the window",
# test_json.c's "visible under ASan", test_trace.c, test_tls_verify.c — and
# until this target existed there was no way to build with one, so an
# out-of-bounds read on exactly those paths went undetected. Adding it found two
# real defects immediately: a read below mm/heap.c's arena in test_mem_tools.c,
# and a queued reply whose stack buffer had already gone out of scope in
# test_chat.c. Same rules and same sources as test-host; only the flags differ,
# and tests/build/.host-flags is what makes the rebuild honest.
#
# THE ONE EXCEPTION. On Mach-O the tool registry is emulated by letting the
# linker pack one 8-byte global per REGISTER_TOOL into "__DATA,tool_table" and
# walking it as an array; ASan's per-global redzones make that walk read padding.
# tests/host/tooltable.h annotates the entries it owns so the walk stays legal,
# but two tool sources carry their own copy of that shim (REGISTER_VFS_TOOL in
# tools/vfs_tools.c, the same in tools/agent_tools.c) and cannot be annotated
# from here, so the two suites that link them switch global instrumentation off.
# Heap, stack, use-after-free/scope and every UBSan check stay on for all of
# them. The real fix is one attribute in those two files.
#
# THE SECOND EXCEPTION, for the same reason one level down. test_fiber runs real
# code on stacks carved out of mm/heap.c's arena, which is a global. ASan's STACK
# instrumentation writes frame redzones into the shadow of whatever memory a
# frame occupies, so a fiber's frames poison the shadow of the arena — and it is
# never unpoisoned, because a suspended fiber's frames never return. The next
# kfree() of that block then trips a "stack-buffer-underflow ... inside global
# variable default_arena" inside the allocator's own poisoning memset. That is
# ASan describing this design back to itself, not a defect: a green run with
# -asan-stack=0 is the honest one. Heap, globals, use-after-free and every UBSan
# check stay on, and the poison bands in core/fiber.c are the stack-overflow
# detector here anyway — tests/host/test_fiber.c proves they fire.
