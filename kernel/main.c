 * THE TRANSCRIPT
 *   Three voices share one console, and they are told apart by shape, not by
 *   chat-client labels:
 *
 *       > write hello into /etc/motd          <- the operator; only the '>' is
 *                                                printed by the kernel, the rest
 *                                                is the line editor's echo
 *       [vfs_write /etc/motd bytes=5 -> ok]   <- the kernel, in C, after the
 *                                                call returned (trace.h)
 *       Done - /etc/motd now holds "hello".   <- the model, prose, persuasive
 *                                                and unverified
 *
 *   Brackets are facts. Prose is a claim. That distinction is the only audit
 *   trail a machine with no `ls` can offer, so nothing else is allowed to print
 *   in bracket form.

 * of model-authored apps (app_tick). Both are bounded, neither blocks, and
 * both return immediately when nothing is open — see the event-loop section of
 * include/gui.h and the APP_MAX_TICKS / APP_TICK_MIN_MS reasoning in
 * include/app.h.
 *
 * They used to run only in wait_for_sentence(), i.e. only while the machine
 * had nothing to do. The moment an API turn started, the kernel descended into
 * net/net.c and spun there for seconds with the whole machine stopped: a clock
 * app froze mid-second, the pointer stuck where it was, and a window dragged
 * over the console left a hole until the model answered.
 *
 * So this pair now lives in its own fiber, and every wait in the kernel yields
 * to it (net/net.c's net_service(), and wait_for_sentence() below). The body
 * is two calls, a clock read and a yield, and it is that small on purpose: it
 * is the only fiber the kernel creates, it is the one that must never hog the
 * CPU, and both calls in it are documented as bounded — which is the whole of
 * the argument that it cannot hang the machine, given that nothing here can
 * preempt it (see include/fiber.h).
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS: app_tick() first. A tick handler's assignments change widget
 * text, which marks damage; gui_tick()'s gui_sync() is what paints damage. The
 * other way round a clock would be a frame stale, which on a machine whose only
 * moving picture IS the clock is the whole of the visible behaviour. */

/* HOW OFTEN THE UI FIBER ACTUALLY DOES ITS WORK, and why it is not "always".
 *
 * The loops that yield to this fiber are polling loops: net/net.c's goes round
 * roughly 8000 times a second during a model turn, and wait_for_sentence()
 * spins as fast as the CPU allows. Repainting the screen and running app tick
 * handlers at that rate is redundant work — nothing can see 8000 frames a
 * second, and app.h's own floor on a periodic handler is APP_TICK_MIN_MS = 50.
 * Worse than redundant on real hardware: gui_sync() calls console_sync(),
 * which rescans every console cell, and a composite writes to a framebuffer
 * that is uncached write-combining memory across PCIe.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS *NOT* CLAIMED TO BUY, because it was measured and it did not.
 * Timed over seven to nine boots each, the network phase (the "net: up at"
 * line to the "[http]" line — DNS, the TLS handshake and a real round trip to
 * api.anthropic.com) is the same to within its own noise in every variant:
 *
 *     no fibers at all                  median 0.91 s   (min 0.79)
 *     fibers, ui unthrottled            median 0.95 s   (min 0.77)
 *     fibers, ui throttled, clock open  median 0.87 s   (min 0.77)
 *     fibers, ui unthrottled, clock open median 0.79 s  (min 0.66)
 *
 * So neither the context switches nor the repainting cost anything a real
 * network round trip can notice, and the throttle is here because bounding
 * this fiber's duty cycle is right, not because a slowdown was found. Said out
 * loud so nobody later "optimises" against a number that was never real.
 *
 * 4 ms is 250 Hz: far above any display, above the 200 Hz PS/2 mouse, and
 * eight times inside gui_tick()'s GUI_EVENT_BUDGET of 32 events, so no mouse
 * event can back up and no click can be late by anything a person could
 * notice. Between two of those the fiber still yields immediately, so the
 * scheduler is never blocked and the network loop is never delayed. */
